      "Margie Morgan was recently scammed out of US$2,000 (RM8,405) in a scheme involving Zelle digital payments and a woman who posed as a representative of Wells Fargo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgan, a food entrepreneur in Edina, Minnesota, fell victim to the scam because it was a new form of phishing, the practice of sending fraudulent communications that look real. It began as a text message to Morgan’s phone that appeared to be from Wells Fargo, but ultimately wasn’t.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m embarrassed at myself because I thought I was smarter than this,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The texts asked Morgan if she had authorised money transfers from her account. Morgan hit “no” and immediately received a call from a woman who portrayed herself as a Wells Fargo representative.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgan said she didn’t think much about it because she received legitimate phone calls from the bank and American Express in the past asking about fraudulent activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "The woman told Morgan that to recover the unauthorised transactions, Morgan would need to make reverse transfers to herself via Zelle. She followed the woman’s directions, which involved using a PIN the scammer gave her. But the money flowed out of her account, not into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Morgan, 57, learned later from an actual Wells Fargo representative that she’d been duped out of US$3,000 (RM12,607). Wells Fargo was able to recover one US$1,000 (RM4,202) transfer but not a second transfer for US$2,000 (RM8,405), which had been processed, Morgan said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’ve been beside myself because I started a small business last year and US$2,000 (RM8,405) cleaned me out,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wells Fargo spokesman Kevin Friedlander said he couldn’t discuss the specifics of Morgan’s case, citing customer privacy and confidentiality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zelle is an immediate form of payment and scammers who receive payments from victims typically withdraw the funds from the receiving financial institution immediately, making recovery difficult, Friedlander said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will continue to work with other financial institutions and law enforcement in an effort to track down suspects and attempt to recover funds for our customers,” Friedlander said.\n",
      "\n",
      "On its website, Zelle draws a distinction between fraud and scams, saying a scam happens when a customer is “knowingly involved”.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Even if you were tricked or persuaded into authorising a payment for a good or service someone said they were going to provide, but they didn’t fulfill it, this would be considered a scam,” Zelle warns. As a result, it tells customers they may not be able to get their money back.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wells Fargo told Morgan in writing that it asked the receiving financial institution to return her money. She said the bank added there was no guarantee that would happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Customers at other banks are reporting similar scams. And on its website, Wells Fargo describes how such “bank imposter” scams unfold. The scammer contacts a person pretending to be someone from a bank and they often know some personal information, likely from social media, public records or a data breach.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Typically, they say that there is suspicious activity on your account and that to stop it you will need to provide an access code from a text or e-mail,” the Wells Fargo description said. “They may also ask for other information, such as a PIN or your username and password. Other times, you are told to send money to yourself to ‘reverse’ the payment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Friedlander noted that Wells Fargo will not contact customers and ask them to send money to themselves or anyone else to prevent or stop fraud on their account.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wells Fargo warns customers not to share an access code, PIN or password with anyone who requests it. Wells Fargo said it only sends a code when prompted by an action a customer initiated, such as signing on to online banking or sending money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wells Fargo said it does not ask customers to send money to anyone, to “reverse a transfer”, “receive a refund” or anything similar. – Star Tribune/Tribune News Service\n",

      "LONDON (Reuters) - Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has stepped up pressure for tougher economic sanctions on Moscow, including potentially shutting the country out of SWIFT - the world's main international payments network - hitting Russian trade and making it harder for Russian companies to do business.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT IS SWIFT?\n",
      "\n",
      "SWIFT, or the \"Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication\", is a secure messaging system that facilitates rapid cross-border payments, making international trade flow smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks which connect to the SWIFT system and establish relationships with other banks can use SWIFT messages to make payments.\n",
      "\n",
      "The messages are secure so that payment instructions are typically honoured without question. This allows banks to process high volumes of transactions at speed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has become the principal mechanism for financing international trade. In 2020, around 38 million SWIFT ‘FIN messages’ were sent each day over the SWIFT platform, according to its 2020 Annual Review. Each year, trillions of dollars are transferred using the system.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHO OWNS SWIFT?\n",
      "\n",
      "SWIFT, founded in the 1970s, is a co-operative of thousands of member institutions which use the service.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based in Belgium, SWIFT makes a modest profit -- €36 million in 2020, based on its 2020 Annual Review. It is run principally as a service to its members.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHY WOULD A SWIFT BAN BE SO SERIOUS?\n",
      "\n",
      "If SWIFT were to exclude Russian banks, it would restrict the country’s access to financial markets across the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian companies and individuals would find it harder to pay for imports and receive cash for exports, borrow or invest overseas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russian banks could use other channels for payments such as phones, messaging apps or email. The would allow Russian banks to make payments via banks in countries which have not imposed sanctions but since alternatives are likely to be less efficient and secure, transaction volumes could fall and costs rise.\n",
      "\n",
      "HOW WOULD A SWIFT BAN ON RUSSIA AFFECT OTHER COUNTRIES?\n",
      "\n",
      "If Russian banks were cut off from SWIFT, exporters would find selling goods to Russia riskier and more expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia is a big buyer of manufactured goods. The Netherlands and Germany are its second and third biggest trading partners, based on World Bank data, although Russia is not a top 10 export market for either country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign buyers of Russian goods would also find it more difficult, potentially prompting them to seek alternative suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when it comes to Russian oil and gas, foreign buyers could find it harder to find replacement suppliers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia is the main EU supplier of crude oil, natural gas and solid fossil fuels, according to the European Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banning Russia from SWIFT is unlikely to be agreed at this stage, several EU sources have said.\n",
      "\n",
      "WHAT WILL SWIFT DO?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the past, SWIFT has resisted calls to impose bans on certain countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "It describes itself as neutral and has said it would not take a decision to disconnect institutions as a result of political pressure.\n",
      "\n",
      "IS SWIFT BOUND BY ECONOMIC SANCTIONS?\n",
      "\n",
      "Belgium-based SWIFT is bound by Belgian and European Union rules, which would include economic sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "SWIFT's website says: “Whilst sanctions are imposed independently in different jurisdictions around the world, SWIFT cannot arbitrarily choose which jurisdiction’s sanction regime to follow.”\n",
      "\n",
      "In March 2012, the European Union barred SWIFT from serving Iranian firms and individuals which had been sanctioned in relation to Tehran’s nuclear programme. The list included the central bank and other big banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "A SWIFT spokesman declined to say how the organisation would respond to any U.S. sanctions.\n",

      "Two Goldman Sachs GS.N bankers concocted a scheme involving their wives to conceal kickbacks they received for helping to loot Malaysia's 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, one of the bankers testified on Thursday at the corruption trial of the other, Roger Ng.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tim Leissner, who had been Ng's supervisor at Goldman before becoming the star government witness against him, said he received kickback payments from a Malaysian intermediary, Jho Low, for helping embezzle funds Goldman raised for 1MDB through three bond sales.\n",

      "Leissner testified after pleading guilty to money laundering and corruption charges, while Ng has pleaded not guilty to conspiring to commit money laundering and violating an anti-corruption law.\n",

      "\n",
      "Leissner, 52, said that after the first bond sale in 2012, he received $35 million from Low, and transferred half of it to Ng.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "His lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, has denied the payment was a kickback, and said the men's wives had a legitimate business together.\n",

      "Agnifilo signaled in his opening statement that he will challenge Leissner's credibility by asking about his infidelity.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on Russia in retaliation for its invasion of Ukraine, targeting its two biggest banks and members of the elite in new measures as Washington warned more action could come.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the targets were five major Russian banks, including state-backed Sberbank and VTB, the country's two largest lenders, as well as wealthy individuals and their families. The United States also announced new export control measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington imposed the new sanctions after Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday, assaulting by land, sea and air in the biggest attack by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department said U.S. banks must sever their correspondent banking ties - which allow banks to make payments between one another and move money around the globe - with Russia's largest lender, Sberbank, and 25 of its subsidiaries within 30 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "The restrictions aim to hurt the Russian economy by blocking Sberbank from processing and settling payments within the U.S. financial system.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Washington stopped short of wielding the U.S. government's most powerful sanctioning tool against the bank and did not add it to the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list, which would freeze any of its U.S. assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "But a senior U.S. administration official warned that the United States could further tighten sanctions against Russia if it escalates its aggression against Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Reuters first reported correspondent banking restrictions were part of the U.S. sanctions package on Sunday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel Alter, a former general counsel at New York's Department of Financial Services, said: \"The power of the sanction comes from the fact that most of the world trade at some point is conducted in dollars.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington also added Russia's second-largest bank, VTB, as well as three others - Otkritie, Novikombank and Sovcombank - to SDN list.\n",
      "\n",
      "The move effectively kicks the banks out of the U.S. financial system, bans their trade with Americans and freezes their U.S. assets.\n",

      "Article's Text:\n",
      "PETALING JAYA: UEM Sunrise Bhd aims to return to profitability this year after the Covid-19 pandemic widened the group’s losses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The property development company has been loss-making over the last eight quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to its chief executive officer Sufian Abdullah, the group has set out a three-year strategy that includes disposing of non-core assets, masterplan revisions at some of its major property projects in Johor, and refocusing its revenue stream in property development.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We expect UEM Sunrise to return to the black by this year driven by a combination of asset monetisation, refocusing of revenue stream, and sizeable unbilled sales for the coming years,” he told reporters after the group’s results briefing for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 (FY21) yesterday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suffian said the company has earmarked RM300mil of potential assets for the disposal that include land, car parks as well as some office and residential units.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "UEM Sunrise\n",
      "\n",
      "As at Dec 31, UEM Sunrise’s unbilled sales stood at RM2.4bil and it had cash of RM900mil.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has a total land bank of 10,624 acres of which 90% is in Johor.\n",
      "\n",
      "When asked about UEM Sunrise’s plan for its Johor assets, Sufian said the group is looking to sell some land in the state, but will retain its land bank that has been earmarked for township development.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are in the process of revising our master plan in Johor to provide a sustainable revenue stream to the group, as well as to preserve and enhance the land value,” he explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "He reckoned that the property market in the country would remain challenging especially with the end of the home ownership campaign (HOC) and volatile raw material prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We do not anticipate the HOC continuing beyond December 2021. However, we understand that the key to success this year is putting out the right product while communicating the value of our products.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We expect that the momentum will pick up again in the second half of this year,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the challenges, Sufian said UEM Sunrise has targeted a higher property sales of RM1.5bil, and earmarked new property development projects of RM3.3bil in gross development value (GDV).\n",
      "\n",
      "For FY21, UEM Sunrise’s net loss narrowed to RM214.33mil from RM277.28mil a year ago due to impairment provisions for its inventories and its assets and properties amounting to RM88mil.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue increased to RM1.21bil from RM1.14bil previously on the back of higher property sales of RM1.46bil compared with RM1.13bil in FY20, which exceeded the company’s target of RM1.2bil.\n",
      "\n",
      "CGS-CIMB Research expected UEM Sunrise to turn in a core net profit in FY22 compared with core net loss in FY20 and FY21, as business operations and ongoing projects’ progress normalises post Covid-19 lockdowns.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We raise our FY22 and FY23 forecast earnings per share by 6% to 24% to reflect the changes in project development timelines and higher new launches,” it said in a report yesterday.\n",
      "\n",

      "MONTREAL: The Bank of Canada (BoC) will raise interest rates by 25 basis points on March 2, earlier than previously thought and ahead of the United States Federal Reserve (Fed), according to economists surveyed in a Reuters poll, which also showed expectations that rates will be higher by year-end than previously thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just one month ago, economists predicted the BoC would wait until the second quarter to hike rates. But persistently higher inflation, which accelerated to a 30-year peak in January, prompted them to bring forward expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other major central banks, including the Fed and the Bank of England, are also expected to raise rates in March to tackle inflation which is at multi-decade highs, with some economists calling for an aggressive 50-basis-point move by the Fed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The poll, which was conducted Feb 17-23, found only a 20% median probability of a 50-basis-point rate rise at the BoC’s March meeting, with all 25 economists predicting a 25-basis-point hike to 0.50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would say they’re not behind the curve because inflation expectations are well-anchored,” said Andrew Kelvin, chief Canada strategist at TD Securities.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think that’s probably the best way of framing this. But it is imperative they do hike rates now because if they wait any longer, they will be behind the curve.”\n",

      "Developing economies, where food and energy weigh more heavily in household budgets, have already been slower to recover from the pandemic than their rich-world peers.

      "Even for Europe, the pain will likely be tolerable.

      "Insight - ECB has to fight housing bubble with its hands tied\n",
      "n\n",
      "Article's Text:\n",
      "FROM Luxembourg to New Zealand, global house prices have been surging as pandemic stimulus and a shift to work from home added fuel to a multi-year boom driven by historically low interest rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "But whereas authorities from Auckland to Stockholm have shown they can pull monetary and regulatory levers to tame property prices, the eurozone’s fragmentation into 19 national markets means the European Central Bank’s (ECB) hands are tied.\n",
      "\n",
      "Five of the 10 countries worldwide that experienced the biggest increase in house prices in 2020 were in the eurozone, according to International Monetary Fund data.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is raising concerns at the ECB about a new housing bubble that could wreak economic and financial havoc just as memories of the 2008 crash start to fade.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the ECB cannot jack up interest rates too fast or far to help some eurozone members because it would hammer the most indebted eurozone countries, such as Italy and Greece, and the central bank is keen to avoid another debt crisis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead, it must rely on often reluctant governments to cool off property markets with so-called macro-prudential tools, which also have the benefit of targeting real estate directly rather than the economy at large.\n",
      "\n",
      "They range from making banks build up extra capital when they make home loans to introducing deeply unpopular caps on the size of mortgages based on the purchase price or the income of the buyer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Especially in the eurozone, with one rate for different countries, macro-prudential tools are much better suited to fighting housing bubbles,” said Grégory Claeys, a senior fellow at the Bruegel think-tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trouble is the ECB cannot apply these brakes directly and can only issue warnings and recommendations via the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB), the European Union’s financial stability watchdog.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the latest such move, the ERSB – which is based inside the ECB and headed by Christine Lagarde – urged Germany and Austria to impose limits on mortgages and raise capital demands for banks.\n",
      "\n",
      "But its prescriptions are not binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germany’s finance minister, for example, pushed back on the recommendation to introduce a loan-to-value ratio for home buyers. History shows this type of regulation can work.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Korean authorities were able to slow down house price growth by imposing a debt-to-income ratio in the early 2000s.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Sweden briefly managed to bring down the cost of a dwelling in 2018 by demanding that homeowners repay at least 1% of their loan balance every year if they took mortgages greater than 4.5 times their household income.\n",
      "\n",
      "“That would have a very strong impact and very fast,” said Matthias Holzhey, who co-authors UBS’s annual Global Real Estate Bubble Index.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet it would also require some unpopular choices, like making mortgages all but unaffordable to poorer households.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is why national regulators in the eurozone, who often include government officials who would pay the electoral price of public backlash, have been dragging their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Germany for example has only just announced plans to apply some brakes, a decade after the start of its housing boom and with house prices already 20%-35% over-valued according to the Bundesbank.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you implement tough macroprudential measures, you disturb the party,” said Commerzbank’s chief economist Joerg Kraemer.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It requires a very independent position.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The ESRB said this month that Finland and the Netherlands were not doing enough to curb mortgage lending despite its recommendations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’s no cost for a politician for not acting,” said Bruegel’s Claeys.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We need an independent financial stability council that can bite.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet research shows monetary policy still matters and can either make macro-prudential regulation more effective if it supports it or it can trump if it works in the opposite direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "That could be the case in the eurozone, some economists say, doubting regulation will make much of a difference as long as mortgage rates remain below inflation, making property investments appealing for households and professional investors alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "Borrowers were locking in an annual mortgage interest rate of just 1.3% for 10 years in December, according to the latest ECB data, compared to an expected inflation rate of just under 2% over that period.Commerzbank’s Kraemer is one of many economists who expect these negative real yields to persist, blunting the effect of regulatory curbs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When rates are too low it’s an uphill struggle,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ireland is a case in point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Home prices there rose by 14.4% last year despite tough limits introduced in 2015, which cap mortgages at 3.5 times a borrower’s gross annual income.\n",
      "\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR: Malayan Banking Bhd ’s (Maybank) net profit for its fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 rose 33.8% to RM2.06bil from RM1.54bil in the previous corresponding period as earnings were mainly driven by the gradual reopening of the economy during the quarter.\n",
      "\n",
      "Revenue in the fourth quarter stood at RM11.26bil compared with RM12.24bil a year earlier\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank chairman Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa said the group is heartened by signs of gradual recovery across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We are seeing the resumption of more economic activities, improving vaccination rates and accommodative policies, which are good signs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will stay ahead in managing our key business risks and be prepared for any resurgence in Covid-19 cases,” he said yesterday during a virtual press conference on Maybank’s financial performance for 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank chairman Tan Sri Zamzamzairani Mohd Isa said the group is heartened by signs of gradual recovery across the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank group president and chief executive officer Datuk Seri Abdul Farid Alias said he expects the group to remain stable in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We will continue to drive income growth from previous opportunities in wealth management, global markets, investment banking, asset management and insurance by leveraging on our digital capabilities,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdul Farid said Maybank also aims to preserve capital liquidity, as the group moves into the recovery phase and continues to provide support to its customers in need.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our expectation is for us to be stable in 2022, with the possibility of an expansion of five basis points, given the possibility of a rising rate environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Although all indicators are pointing to a better year, we are guiding for return on equity to be between 9.5% and 10% in 2022, partly because we are not really out of the woods yet, as well as the impact of the one-off prosperity tax imposed by the government.”\n",
      "\n",
      "For its financial year ended Dec 31, 2021, Maybank’s net profit surged to RM8.10bil from RM6.48bil in the previous corresponding period, while revenue stood at RM45.96bil against RM51.03bil a year earlier.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday, Maybank, South-East Asia’s fourth-largest bank by assets, said its financial performance in 2021 was driven by the improving regional economic outlook that supported the group’s higher operating income.\n",
      "\n",
      "Total group gross loans grew 5.7% year-on-year as at Dec 31, 2021, lifted mainly by increases of 8.7% and 4.1% respectively in its Singapore and Malaysia operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, its Indonesian operations saw a slight decline of 3.2% in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank\n",
      "\n",
      "“Steady growth was recorded in the global banking segment across all three home markets while the community financial services franchise recorded good growth in Singapore and Malaysia.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Commenting on its loan growth target for this year, group chief financial officer Khalijah Ismail said Maybank will be “tracking against industry growth” in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you refer to some of the published numbers in terms of the growth for Malaysia, similarly for Singapore and Indonesia, our target has always been along those lines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank said total current account and savings accounts (Casa) deposits rose 17.2%, driven by strong growth across all home markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Consequently, the Casa ratio expanded to 47.1% as at December 2021 from 42.8% a year earlier. The strong Casa growth also helped lower the group’s cost of funds and lifted net interest margin for the full year by 22 basis points to 2.32%.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, total group deposits expanded 6.5%, led primarily by a 10.2% growth in Malaysia.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank however said this was moderated by a decrease of 6.9% and 0.4% in Singapore and Indonesia respectively, as part of their strategy to reduce dependency on costlier fixed deposits.\n",
      "\n",
      "The group also said it continued with its strategy to maintain robust capital and liquidity positions, with its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio at 15.40% and total capital ratio at 18.83% as at Dec 31, 2021, making it one of the best capitalised banks in the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The group’s liquidity coverage ratio stood at a healthy 136.4%, way above the regulatory requirement of 100%.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The group also registered an improvement in asset quality with its gross impaired loans ratio declining 24 basis points to 1.99% in December 2021 from 2.23% a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, loan loss coverage improved to 111.9% in December 2021 from 106.3% previously, as a result of the additional provisioning undertaken and as several older impaired accounts were written-off throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Notwithstanding this, Maybank continues to maintain stringent monitoring of its credit portfolios while at the same time, undertaking proactive engagement with clients facing financial distress to assist them in managing their commitments effectively,” it said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Maybank said its impairment losses had reduced by 36.6%, as the bank had taken pre-emptive provisioning for potentially bad loans and financial investments since the pandemic started in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank said net operating income grew 2.8% to RM25.45bil, tracking Malaysia’s economic growth of 3.1% in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This was achieved on the back of a 14.6% year-on-year increase in total net fund based income to RM19.09bil as a result of stronger loan growth as well as robust improvement in Casa.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was, however, partially offset by a 21.6% decline in net fee based income to RM6.36bil, mainly from lower net gain in investment income and marked-to-market losses on the fixed income portfolio held by its insurance unit due to rising yields.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Maybank said growth in cost was contained at 2.6%, well below income growth, resulting in pre-provisioning operating profit coming in higher at RM13.93bil from RM13.54bil a year ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybank also declared a single-tier second interim dividend of 30 sen per share, comprising an electable portion of 7.5 sen per share under its dividend reinvestment plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "This brings the full-year dividend to 58 sen per share and translates into a payout ratio of 84.5% or RM6.84bil in total.\n",
      "\n",
      "Separately, the group’s Islamic banking business saw a sterling 90.3% rise in pre-tax profit to RM4.43bil compared with RM2.33bil a year earlier, boosted by a 24.8% increase in total income to RM6.68bil.\n",
      "\n",
      "As at December 2021, total Islamic financing constituted 64.9% of Maybank’s total Malaysia financing, while Maybank Islamic’s market share of Islamic assets in Malaysia stood at 29.8%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, its insurance arm, Etiqa Insurance & Takaful, saw a 5.4% rise in total net adjusted premium on the back of an 8.4% increase in total life and family premium.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, pre-tax profit declined 8.3% year-on-year to RM909.7mil, owing to lower marked-to-market value of its fixed income portfolio arising from the rise in yields in 2021.\n",

      "THE disabled community welcomes the latest initiatives by Petaling Jaya City Council (MBPJ) to upgrade and add parking bays for their use in the busy SS2 commercial area.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beautiful Gate Foundation for the Disabled acting executive director Ivy Pua, who shops in the area frequently, has encountered many difficulties due to misuse of parking bays.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There were only two Persons with Disabilities (PWD) parking bays in SS2 previously, and they were often taken up by able-bodied motorists,” said Pua, who uses a wheelchair to get around.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sometimes we had to park at normal parking spots that presented challenges in navigating and accessing our wheelchairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We had to rely on other people for help, making it difficult for us to live independently,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Members of Beautiful Gate, which is headquartered in SS2, find it easier to go to the banks, shops and market in SS2 now that there are more PWD parking bays in the area.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope the able-bodied will no longer misuse PWD parking bays for their own convenience.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Motorists should also be aware that when they park near ramps linking to pavements, they are blocking wheelchair users from accessing the pavements,” said Pua.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thomas Yeoh, who uses a motorised wheelchair, is happy with the improvements that will make the SS2 commercial area more disabled-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Most of the shops are easier to access now as almost every block has a ramp at one end,” said Yeoh, who lives and works in SS2.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said the able-bodied community appeared indifferent to the plight of the disabled.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many times, ramps to walkways are blocked by vehicles or large obstacles and PWD parking bays are often taken over by able-bodied users.”\n",
      "\n",
      "On the improvements by the city council, he said certain ramps should have a gentler incline and that more tactile tiles could be installed for the benefit of the visually impaired community.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Facilities should be accessible to all, including people with mobility problems and senior citizens,” said Yeoh.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I hope other cities and towns will emulate MBPJ via workshops or engagements with PWD.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Universal accessibility\n",
      "\n",
      "The project in SS2 is part of an ongoing initiative by MBPJ to provide universal accessibility in major commercial areas within the city. MBPJ councillor Sakinah Bibi Nagoor said the city council was working on providing and improving disabled-friendly facilities to create a barrier-free city in line with United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many buildings, especially those in commercial areas, are not PWD-friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Many of the mature residential and commercial areas in Petaling Jaya were developed before the enactment of the Uniform Building By-law 1984 (UBBL).”\n",
      "\n",
      "In Sept 1990, amendment 34A in the UBBL made it compulsory for buildings to provide access for the disabled community.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Any new buildings constructed after this amendment was enforced, whether private or government, have to set aside parking spots for PWDs. This is a condition that has to be fulfilled before MBPJ can issue the development order,” said Sakinah.\n",
      "\n",
      "“For older private buildings constructed before 1990, MBPJ can only suggest that PWD parking lots be built as the cost to refurbish is on the property owner. The upgrading of older government buildings is up to the Federal Government,” she added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sakinah, who has a physical disability herself, has been working closely with MBPJ’s Universal Design Unit to improve PWD facilities in Petaling Jaya.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Our guidelines state that PWD parking bays should comprise 2% of an area’s total parking space.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This is not ideal, especially in a mature city such as Petaling Jaya where there is an increasing number of PWD and elderly residents,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was decided that the Universal Design Unit would accept requests for PWD parking bays from councillors and owners of clinics and grocery stores in PJ.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Approval will be given after site visits and recommendations by the unit,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Locations for PWD parking bays, she said, were determined by factors such as safety and the distance to a clinic, supermarket or bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A PWD parking bay has to be larger than the average size to provide wheelchair accessibility,” she said, adding that a disabled parking bay measured 6m long and 3.6m wide.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A PWD parking bay can be equipped with a ramp and railing if there is a significant height difference between the bay and shop walkway or if there are steps.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Ramps and mini-ramps are also built along shop walkways so there will be continuous accessibility along an entire row of shops. Newly built bays come with standard PWD signboards.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The upgrading of parking bays for the disabled started in PJ New Town in 2019, followed by Sea Park in 2020 and SS2 last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "“A total of 11 PWD parking bays were built in SS2, along with 60 ramps and mini-ramps for better accessibility,” said Sakinah, adding that these were built on existing parking bays.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The SS2 project, which started in November last year and completed in January, cost RM108,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Starbucks and Klinik Alam Medic are some of the locations where the PWD parking bays can be found.”\n",
      "\n",
      "She said MBPJ allocated RM450,000 this year to build PWD parking bays and ramps in selected commercial areas in Kelana Jaya, Taman Sea and Taman Mayang Jaya as well as eight council-owned markets.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The number of PWD parking bays at each market depends on the size of the market. Pasar Jalan Othman will have two PWD bays while the markets in Sections 14 and 17 will have one PWD bay each.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The PWD parking bays are for individuals with physical disabilities registered with the Social Welfare Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those who lived or worked in Petaling Jaya must also have a PWD parking sticker obtained from MBPJ’s Community Welfare Department at Menara MBPJ.\n",

      "Trial on hold after 15,500 documents withheld\n",
      "n\n",
      "Article's Text:\n",
      "NEW YORK: The trial of former Goldman Sachs banker Roger Ng, who is accused of helping loot Malaysia’s 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, will be paused due to late disclosure of some evidence by prosecutors to the defence, the judge in the case ruled.\n",
      "\n",
      "The evidence, in the form of 15,500 documents, is related to Tim Leissner, Ng’s former boss and the star witness in the trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ng, Goldman’s former head of investment banking in Malaysia, has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and to violate an anti-bribery law. In the dock: Ng has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiring to launder money and to violate an anti-bribery law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors said Ng received millions of dollars in kickbacks for helping embezzle funds from 1MDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prosecutors said in a court filing – more than a week after opening statements in Ng’s trial began – that they had just learned that one US Department of Justice (DOJ) division did not share with them or Ng the documents related to Leissner.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The government absolutely, absolutely, and admittedly at this point did not live up to its obligations,” Marc Agnifilo, a defence attorney for Ng, told US district judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn federal court outside the jury’s presence.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Evidence is coming in drips and drabs.” Agnifilo said the documents could be critical for the defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brodie called the late disclosure “troubling”, noting that she had previously asked prosecutors to make sure all disclosures were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leissner, who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2018, is testifying against Ng, 49, as the government’s star witness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brodie said she would allow prosecutors to finish questioning Leissner, then pause the trial before cross-examination to give Agnifilo time to review the new documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I will give you as much time as you need,” Brodie said, although she noted that the trial could not be delayed indefinitely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agnifilo argues that the US$35mil (RM147mil) which Ng received, that the government calls ill-gotten gains, was actually derived from an unrelated business venture between Ng’s wife and Leissner’s ex-wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "Assistant US Attorney Alixandra Smith said the delayed disclosure was an “inexcusable error” and did not object to pausing the trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial stems from one of the biggest financial scandals in history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Between 2009 and 2014, Goldman reaped some US$600mil (RM2.5bil) in fees for helping 1MDB sell US$6.5bil (RM27.3bil) in bonds, but around US$4.5bil (RM18.9bil) of that was diverted, and Goldman bankers bribed officials to win business for the bank, US prosecutors said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2020, Goldman paid a nearly US$3bil (RM12.6bil) fine and arranged for its Malaysian unit to plead guilty in US court. — Reuters\n",

      "\n",
      "A day after Goldman Sachs banker Tim Leissner had alleged that Tawfiq had been bribed before a large sum of money was transferred, the husband of former Bank Negara governor Tan Sri Dr Zeti Akhtar Aziz denied receiving bribes in the transaction linked to the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) scandal.\n",

      "(Reuters) - The United States and its allies have vowed to hit Russia with harsh sanctions after Russian forces invaded Ukraine on Thursday in a massed assault by land, sea and air - the biggest by one state against another in Europe since World War Two.\n",
      "\n",
      "Western capitals introduced an initial round of sanctions after Russian President Vladimir Putin recognised two breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden said Washington and its allies will announce \"severe sanctions\" with further measures later on Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to outline a new package of measures to parliament at 1700 GMT.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union, also set to announce fresh curbs later in the day, said the sanctions package will hit Russia's economy severely, increase capital outflow, raise inflation and gradually erode the country's industrial base.\n",
      "\n",
      "South Korea, Norway and other countries have also pledged to join measures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below are details on the curbs proposed so far and what other sanctions could target Russia:\n",
      "\n",
      "BANKS & FINANCIAL FIRMS\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain has already announced sanctions on five banks - Bank Rossiya, Black Sea Bank, Genbank, IS Bank and Promsvyazbank. All are smaller lenders, with only Promsvyazbank on the central bank's list of systematically important lenders.\n",
      "\n",
      "President Biden has already announced sanctions on VEB bank and Russia's military bank, referring to Promsvyazbank, which does defence deals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department said: \"All assets under U.S. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen and U.S. individuals and entities are prohibited from doing business.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "A senior U.S. administration official added that Sberbank, and VTB Bank would face sanctions if the Russian invasion proceeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bank Rossiya is already under U.S. sanctions from 2014 for its close ties to Kremlin officials.\n",
      "\n",
      "The European Union has agreed to blacklist banks involved in financing separatist activities in eastern Ukraine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Russia's large banks are deeply integrated into the global financial system, meaning sanctions could be felt far beyond its borders. Data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) shows European lenders hold the lion's share of the nearly $30 billion in foreign banks' exposure to Russia.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to data from Russia's central bank, total Russian banking foreign assets and liabilities stood at $200.6 billion and $134.5 billion respectively with the U.S. dollar share amounting to around 53% of both, down from 76%-81% two decades ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "SOVEREIGN DEBT & CAPITAL MARKETS\n",
      "\n",
      "The coming package of measures from the EU will \"target the ability of the Russian state and government to access the EU's capital and financial markets and services, to limit the financing of escalatory and aggressive policies,\" the bloc said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will ban EU investors from trading in Russian state bonds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Washington announced fresh restrictions on dealings in Russia sovereign debt this week. Americans, who were already barred from investing in Russian sovereign debt directly, will be banned from purchasing it in the secondary market after March 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain threatened last week to block Russian companies from raising capital in London, Europe's financial centre for such transactions, though stopped short of doing so in its announcements on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even before the latest events, access to Russian bonds had become increasingly restricted.\n",
      "\n",
      "U.S. sanctions imposed in 2015 made future Russian dollar debt ineligible for many investors and key indexes. In April 2021, Biden barred U.S. investors from buying new Russian rouble bonds over accusations of Russian meddling in the U.S. election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The curbs have cut Russia's external debt by 33% since early 2014 - from $733 billion to $489 billion in the third quarter of 2021. Lower debt improves a country's balance sheet on the surface, but deprives it of financing sources that could contribute to economic growth and development.\n",
      "\n",
      "INDIVIDUALS\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States, the EU and Britain have already imposed asset freezes, travel bans and other curbs on a number of Russian individuals.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU on Monday imposed sanctions on five people who were involved in a Russian parliamentary election in annexed Crimea in September 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday, the bloc said it would blacklist all lawmakers in the lower house of the Russian parliament who voted in favour of the recognition of the breakaway regions, freeze any assets they have in the EU and ban them from travelling to the bloc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile Britain has imposed sanctions on three men, Gennady Timchenko and billionaires Igor and Boris Rotenberg - all of whom are allies of President Vladimir Putin from St. Petersburg whose personal fortunes grew precipitously following Putin’s rise to the presidency. All three men are already sanctioned by the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States also imposed sanctions on Tuesday on Russian elites close to Putin, including Alexander Bortnikov, the head of the Federal Security Service, Russia’s powerful domestic security and counterintelligence service.\n",
      "\n",
      "His son, Denis Bortnikov, the deputy president of Russian-state owned financial institution VTB Bank Public Joint Stock Company and a chairman of the bank's management company, was also targeted in Tuesday's move.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also designated was Putin’s first deputy chief of staff and former Russian Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko. He was previously targeted by the United States, EU and Britain in response to the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. His son, Vladimir Kiriyenko, was also designated on Tuesday.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chairman and chief executive of Promsvyazbank was also targeted. The Treasury accused Petr Fradkov of working to transform the bank into one that serves the defence industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States has used the Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) tool - which effectively kicks individuals and companies out of the U.S. banking system, bans their trade with Americans and freezes their U.S. assets - in the past to sanction oligarchs.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it has become more cautious in recent years after 2018 sanctions on the owner of Rusal saw aluminium prices skyrocket and forced Washington to backtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "A bill unveiled by U.S. Senate Democrats in January aimed for sweeping sanctions against top Russian government and military officials, including Putin, and President Biden has said he would be ready to consider personal sanctions on the Russian president.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moscow has said any move to impose sanctions on Putin himself would not harm him personally but would prove \"politically destructive\".\n",
      "\n",
      "ENERGY CORPORATES & NORD STREAM 2\n",
      "\n",
      "The United States and the EU already have sanctions in place on Russia's energy and defence sectors, with state-owned gas company Gazprom, its oil arm Gazpromneft and oil producers Lukoil, Rosneft and Surgutneftegaz facing various types of curbs on exports/imports and debt-raising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sanctions could be widened and deepened, with one possible option being to prevent companies settling in U.S. dollars.\n",

      "Nord Stream 2, a recently completed pipeline from Russia to Germany, was awaiting regulatory approval by EU and German authorities before Berlin put its certification on ice.\n",

      "One of the harshest measures would be to disconnect the Russian financial system from SWIFT, which handles international financial transfers and is used by more than 11,000 financial institutions in more than 200 countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "A senior U.S. official said they are not taking SWIFT sanctions off the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2012, SWIFT disconnected Iranian banks as international sanctions tightened against Tehran over its nuclear programme. Iran lost half its oil export revenue and 30% of its foreign trade, the Carnegie Moscow Center think tank said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among Western countries, the United States and Germany would stand to lose the most from such a move, as their banks are the most frequent SWIFT users with Russian banks, said Maria Shagina at the Carnegie Moscow Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "Calls to cut Russia's SWIFT access were mooted in 2014 when Moscow annexed Crimea, prompting Moscow to develop an alternative messaging system, SPFS.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of messages sent via SPFS was about one-fifth of Russian internal traffic in 2020, according to the central bank, which aims to increase this to 30% in 2023. However, SPFS has struggled to establish itself in international transactions.\n",
