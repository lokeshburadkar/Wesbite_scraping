      "THE vast business opportunities in the healthcare sector that have arisen because of the Covid-19 pandemic have seen many companies on Bursa Malaysia, including those whose core business is not related to the healthcare segment, venturing into the sector this year. It is easy to see why. Rubber glove manufacturers, for one, have been recording super-high profits in this unprecedented time, and the momentum is likely to continue till at least the first half of 2021. Though interest in glove stocks has subsided of late, companies that have diversified into the glove business are set to come onstream from next year and reap the benefits of strong demand for gloves even in a post-pandemic era. Mah Sing Group Bhd is one of these companies. The property developer recently obtained shareholders’ nod to diversify into glove manufacturing and is not ruling out the possibility of venturing into related healthcare products such as personal protective equipment (PPE) and pharmaceutical or medical products and services. Its share price, which has been below RM1 in the past two years, touched an intraday high of RM1.47 on Oct 20, after its glove foray was revealed. Titijaya Land Bhd is another developer that is proposing to diversify into healthcare products, with a distribution agreement with Rubberex Corp (M) Bhd. Under the pact, China’s Sinopharm Medical Equipment Quanzhou Co Ltd will buy gloves from Titijaya, which will be supplied by Rubberex. At the same time, Titijaya will buy the PPE and medical products from Sinopharm, which will then be sold and distributed to Rubberex. Karex Bhd, the world’s biggest condom maker, also joined the fray after announcing plans to manufacture and sell gloves through its wholly-owned subsidiary Innolatex (Thailand) Ltd in August. It will set up a new manufacturing facility in Hat Yai, Thailand, to supplement its existing operations there. Some RM40 million have been earmarked for the initial stage, to set up two production lines, which are expected to have an annual production capacity of 500 million pieces of gloves. At the time of writing, there was no update. Meanwhile, AT Systemization Bhd, an integrated designer and manufacturer of industrial automation systems and machinery, appeared on the radar screen of investors when it announced that it was building a glove manufacturing facility in Perak. The stock’s trading volume hit 2.66 billion shares in a single day in November, accounting for 23% of the total share trading on Bursa. Its shares hit a peak of 30 sen on Nov 16 from below 10 sen early this year. Having said that, none of the companies’ new glove ventures have taken off. Hence, their financial performance will be closely watched going into 2021. Glove demand to stay robust According to the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (Margma), the global shortage of rubber gloves will last beyond 1Q2022. The current order lead time is at least six to eight months. Global glove consumption is forecast to reach 390 billion pieces in 2021 from 330 billion pieces this year, representing an 18.2% growth year on year, says its president Denis Low. CGS-CIMB Research is of the view that the global supply growth in the next two to three years is unlikely to catch up with the demand increase. This is despite the glove makers’ aggressive expansion plans to capture the demand growth. “This is also assuming that there would be no supply disruptions (due to unforeseen circumstances) or delays in expansion plans (construction delays, raw material supply constraints and so on),” it says in a Dec 15 note. The research house foresees global glove supply will grow 15% to 25% annually in the next two to three years, on the back of higher usage and increased healthcare awareness. In a Dec 16 note, Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research notes that demand requests from customers have not been decreasing or slowing down despite the positive inflow of vaccine news. “Rather, the actual demand and supply for gloves would be dependent on when the vaccine is ready for mass immunisation.” HLIB Research estimates that the total production capacity for the big four glove players will increase 14.6% from 185.08 billion pieces this year to 212.15 billion pieces in 2021, and a further 6.3% to 225.48 billion pieces in 2022. Companies associated with the glove industry are also beneficiaries of the strong global demand for gloves. Shares in HLT Global Bhd have jumped sixfold year to date, underpinned by its rubber glove dipping line manufacturing business. ES Ceramics Technology Bhd, which makes hand formers used by the glove industry, more than doubled during the same period. Beneficiaries of the healthcare wave Given that wearing face mask is mandatory in most countries, companies involved in the manufacturing of PPE are also riding the healthcare wave. Those that have diversified into this segment this year include Notion VTec Bhd, Komarkcorp Bhd, Iconic Worldwide Bhd, SCGM Bhd and Pecca Group Bhd. Not forgetting companies that produce the raw materials — the likes of Tek Seng Holdings and Oceancash Pacific Bhd — to manufacture face masks and protective gowns. Luxchem Corp Bhd’s latex and nitrile processing and compounding business has also been given a boost by the surge in demand for PPE and rubber gloves. Texchem Resources Bhd, which is engaged in the restaurant, industrial, food and polymer engineering sectors, has received the Malaysian Investment Development Authority’s green light to produce face shields. Other chemicals companies such as Samchem Holdings Bhd, Hexza Corp Bhd and Hextar Global Bhd are also beneficiaries as their chemicals are used for the manufacturing of personal care products. Many may not be aware that a company such as D’Nonce Technology Bhd is a beneficiary of Covid-19. It is involved in producing packaging boxes for major glove makers in Thailand. Also, Supercomnet Technologies Bhd, an original equipment manufacturer in the automotive cables and medical devices industry, has seen a spike in order volume since the pandemic began. Meanwhile, technology solutions provider K-One Technology Bhd has been granted a licence to manufacture and distribute low-cost ventilators for Covid-19 patients. In September, it also obtained approval from the Medical Device Authority, an agency under the Ministry of Health, to supply nasal swabs in Malaysia. Over in the vaccine space, the impact of the government’s direct deals — with vaccine developers such as Pfizer, Covax and, most recently, AstraZeneca — on the so-called private arrangements remains unclear at this juncture. Bear in mind that any vaccine to be distributed in Malaysia has to get the green light from the National Pharmaceutical Regulatory Agency (NPRA). In the case of Pfizer, Health director-general Tan Sri Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said last week that its vaccine will have to go through a five-phase evaluation process in Malaysia before it can be approved for use by the public. The first phase of the process can take between 90 and 120 days. A day later, however, he said the Ministry of Health would try to cut the evaluation time for the Pfizer vaccine to less than 90 days, so that a conditional approval for the drug may be granted before next March. Pharmaniaga Bhd, Bintai Kinden Corp Bhd, Ho Wah Genting Bhd, Solution Group Bhd, Kanger International Bhd, MyEG Services Bhd, Yong Tai Bhd, Nexgram Holdings Bhd and Metronic Global Bhd have announced their vaccine deals. So far, only Solution and Pharmaniaga will be carrying out the fill-and-finish process in Malaysia. Recently, Solution obtained the NPRA’s approval for the design plan and layout of its vaccine fill-and-finish facility. Solution has been the best performer in terms of share price, rising 1,500% since early this year. Pharmaniaga’s fill-and-finish is pursuant to its agreement signed with Serum Institute of India Pvt Ltd in October. The fill-and-finish product will be marketed, distributed and sold exclusively in Malaysia by Pharmaniaga. The recent news of Bintai Kinden’s two largest shareholders selling stakes in the company caught many by surprise, as the potential earnings from the new venture has yet to kick in. Its second-largest shareholder, Nusankota Development Sdn Bhd, sold its entire 14.4% stake in the engineering and construction company. Also, the largest shareholder, Bintai Holdings (M) Sdn Bhd, disposed of an 8.14% equity interest in the company, reducing its shareholding to 9.05%. Still, not all healthcare ventures have been successful. Early this month, Hong Seng Consolidated Bhd, formerly known as MSCM Holdings Bhd, and RP Integrated Bhd mutually terminated their medical drugs and vaccines joint venture just two months after signing the deal. Hong Seng’s 51%-owned HS Bio Supplies Sdn Bhd and RP Integrated had entered into a partnership to pursue distributorship and opportunities relating to medical drugs and vaccines from China’s Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group Co Ltd.\n",

      "SINCE it was established in September 1963, Lembaga Tabung Haji (TH) has managed and built up the haj pilgrim fund so that depositors have enough savings when they embark on a pilgrimage to Mecca to fulfil the fifth pillar of Islam. Like any other fund management firm, TH invests in stocks, fixed income instruments, property development and other businesses. However, unlike most of Malaysia’s public fund management firms, TH has a high proportion of stocks in its portfolio. Unfortunately, these investments do not always give good returns. A prime example and also one of TH’s most prominent public-listed investee companies is TH Heavy Engineering Bhd (THHE), which has been bleeding red ink since the financial year ended Dec 31, 2014 (FY2014), at the very least. As at June 30 this year, it had accumulated losses of RM697.07 million. TH first emerged as a substantial shareholder in the then Ramunia Holdings Bhd on Nov 2, 2007, and by Dec 24, had enlarged its stake to 5.18%. As Ramunia’s average share price in 2007 was RM1.19, TH’s investment in the company was valued at around RM30.1 million. To be sure, Ramunia had an attractive asset back then. It owned a 170-acre fabrication yard in Teluk Ramunia in southern Johor, one of the largest in Asia. This asset had received three acquisition proposals, but Sime Darby Bhd finally sealed the deal in 2010. In January 2008, before the yard was bought by Sime Darby, Ramunia’s board of directors announced that it had accepted a RM3.2 billion takeover bid from state-controlled MISC Bhd. The RM3.2 billion valuation pegged TH’s 6.1% stake in Ramunia as at Jan 17, 2008, at RM195.2 million. However, the deal was scrapped by MISC in November 2008 following unsatisfactory due diligence findings, one of which was the deterioration in the net asset per share of Ramunia between Oct 31, 2007, and July 31, 2008. Ramunia’s net asset per share as at end-October 2007 was RM1.13, but by end-July 2008, it had tumbled to a mere 41 sen after its oil and gas business registered a pre-tax loss of RM192.67 million for the nine-month period, compared with a pre-tax profit of RM27.4 million in the previous corresponding period. The first cracks were now evident. In notes accompanying its filings with Bursa Malaysia, Ramunia attributed the huge losses to higher project overheads, cost over-runs and losses, foreign exchange losses, disputed change orders, provisional sums, and project bidding costs. Nevertheless, its yard continued to attract interest. In August 2009, the group entered into a definitive sales and purchase agreement with Sime Darby Engineering Sdn Bhd for the disposal of the yard for RM530 million. The deal was completed in April 2010. Post-disposal of the yard, Ramunia acquired a 56.79-acre fabrication yard in Pulau Indah, Port Klang. In spite of the losses of RM279.83 million in FY2008 and RM50.2 million the following year, TH persisted in accumulating Ramunia shares and by Feb 28, 2009, owned 29.68% of the company, making it the largest shareholder. Worse was to come when in its FY2009 audited accounts, its auditor expressed a modified opinion of Ramunia as a going concern because of its net current liabilities of RM29.74 million and shareholders’ deficit of RM28.44 million. Ramunia was classified as a PN17 company on March 1, 2010, but managed to turn around in the financial year ended Oct 31, 2010 (FY2010), with a net profit of RM67.99 million, mainly because it disposed of its assets. Two years later, it exited PN17 status. However, the respite was short-lived. Renamed THHE in 2010, its performance started to deteriorate by the last quarter of FY2013 and by 2015, it had to undertake the issuance of 1.1 billion irredeemable convertible preference shares (ICPS) to stabilise its financials. TH was the only subscriber for the ICPS, pumping in RM275 million for 99.76% of the five-year tenured instruments. Should TH convert the ICPS, it will control more than 64% of THHE. At present, the group is yet again a PN17 company, falling into the category in April last year after its external auditor said it was disclaiming its audited financial statements for FY2016 because of various financial issues the group was facing. At the time of writing, THHE had yet to come up with a regularisation plan to exit its PN17 status. The company has been granted another extension and has to submit the plan before or on April 25 next year. As at last Friday, the counter was trading at 3.5 sen. Another company in which TH was a substantial shareholder was AKN Technology Bhd, which was delisted in June 2011, after failing to regularise its financials. A semiconductor service provider, AKN was classified as a PN17 company after its auditor issued a disclaimer on its annual audited accounts for the financial period ended June 30, 2008. The group had submitted a regularisation plan (RP) in October 2009 but was asked to submit an enhanced one. HwangDBS Investment Bank Bhd was appointed to assist in the preparation and submission of the enhanced RP, which was submitted in January 2010. However, the enhanced RP was rejected by Bursa in September of the same year. At the time of the delisting, TH owned 5.27% of AKN. Its shareholding was only surpassed by businessmen Datuk Ahmad Kabeer Mohamed Nagoor and Ooi Boon Leong, who owned 13.42% of AKN through AKN Capital Sdn Bhd. To be fair, not all of TH’s investments have performed so dismally. The fund owns the biggest stake in the country’s oldest Islamic financial institution, Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd, through its 53.5% equity in BIMB Holdings Bhd. Currently trading at RM3.78, BIMB’s share price has gained a massive 710.5% since its listing in March 1992. Admittedly, those impressive gains have come over 26 years. Perhaps more importantly for TH and its depositors, BIMB has consistently paid dividends over the past 18 years, except for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2006 (FY2006), when the bank posted losses of RM1.23 billion after setting aside RM1.48 billion in provisions during the year. BIMB continued with its dividend payments in the years after the FY2006 losses, but at a single-digit level until FY2011 when it started to pay double-digit dividends, underscoring its significant improvement over the years. In the last financial year, for instance, the bank declared total dividends amounting to 14 sen a share. Through BIMB’s 59.64% stake in Syarikat Takaful Malaysia Bhd (STMB), TH also controls the takaful operator. Over the past five years, STMB’s share price has more than doubled, reaching RM4.05 as at last Friday’s close. The pilgrim fund also holds a 4.9% stake in pharmaceutical company YSP Southeast Asia Holdings Bhd, whose share price over the last five years has also more than doubled to RM2.66.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Jan 29): Tenaga Nasional Bhd, which shares are hovering at the record high level of RM15.98, could see some challenges moving forward to sustain its earnings growth against the backdrop of possible weaker trends in electricity demand, as well as lower contribution from associates. Some analysts have downgraded the utility stock, although it remains as one of the cheapest blue chips on Bursa Malaysia in terms of valuation, after they have combed through the latest set of quarterly result released on Friday (Jan 26). Among the research houses that have downgraded the utility group from a Buy recommendation to Hold are CIMB Equity Research and MIDF Research. Nonetheless, there are some, such as Hong Leong Investment Bank and AmBank, which reiterate their Buy call on Tenaga, partly due to its rather attractive yield of above 4%. CIMB Equity research has downgraded Tenaga from “Add” to “Hold” on earnings risks, despite Tenaga being viewed as one of the cheapest big-cap stocks on the local bourse. CIMB Research opines the stable regulated earnings might not be able to offset the earnings downside from potential lower electricity demand and weaker associate contributions. The downgrade came after announcement of its earnings figures for the financial quarter ended Nov 30, 2017, which CIMB said as “came in within expectations”. Its core net profit for the fifteen months ended Nov 30, 2017 (15MFY17) is about 93% of CIMB’s estimate for the sixteen months ending Dec 31, 2017 (16MFY17) after excluding foreign exchange (forex) and RM150 million accrued interest from its PPA (power purchase agreement savings fund). Note Tenaga has changed its financial year end from Aug 31 to Dec 31 in 2017. Hence, there will be 16 months for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2017 (FY17). Ngo Siew Teng, an analyst with CIMB Equity, shared “the associates are expected to make losses in the near term, before starting to contribute positively in 2020.” Among these associates are GMR Energy (30% owned) in India, Vortex Solar (50% owned) in UK and GAMA Enerji (30% owned) in Turkey. Meanwhile, Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) research however maintain its “Overweight” stance on Tenaga, as HLIB expects the utility company to have steady earnings and cash flow, with implementation of the incentive-based regulation/fuel cost pass through (IBR/FCPT) mechanism. “The lowered 7.3% of regulated assets under regulatory period (RP) 2 (2018-2020) will be offset by higher asset base, new contributors from associates and power plants,” Daniel Wong, an analyst with HLIB research, said. However, Wong said Tenaga’s core earnings for the financial three-month period ended Nov 30, 2017 of RM1.9 billion only make up of 66.8% of HLIB’s four months period ending Dec 31, 2017 (4MFY17)’s estimate, which is below expectation. Tenaga is expected to announce its full year financial results for FY17 soon, with contribution from the month of December. While Ngo has downgraded the target price (TP) for Tenaga to RM16.70, Wong has maintain its TP at RM17.50, based on discounted cash flow to equity valuation. Meanwhile, AmBank, which has reiterated its Buy call, comments an implied dividend yield of between 4.8% and 5.3% (based on dividend payout ratio of 49.9%) remains attractive to investors. Currently, Tenaga is trading at about RM15.90, which is near its all-time high with about 1.4 million shares exchanging hands, giving it a market capitalization of RM90.1 billion.\n",

      "Regional plantations sectorOVERWEIGHT: We are raising our regional plantation sector rating from neutral to overweight following our 7%-18% crude palm oil (CPO) price upgrades for 2010-11 and rollover of our target prices to end-2010. We believe plantation stocks will outperform in the short term as CPO price prospects look rosy for 1Q10. We are pruning our 2009 CPO price forecast by 1% to US$700 (RM2,366) per tonne after taking into account the weaker-than-expected CPO price performance year to date. However, we are raising our CPO price (cif) forecasts by 7% to US$760 per tonne for 2010 and 18% to US$790 per tonne for 2011 in view of the recovering economy, potential impact of the ongoing El Nino on crops and a smaller crop from India due to the late monsoon. Our new local CPO prices are RM2,240 per tonne for 2009, RM2,380 for 2010 and RM2,450 for 2011. We project CPO to trade up to RM2,600 per tonne if the current El Nino causes drought conditions in key planting areas. However, the price strength may not be sustained into 2H10 if South America delivers a bumper soybean crop. In view of our higher CPO price forecasts and recent changes in our exchange rate assumptions, we are raising our FY2010-2011 earnings forecasts for all the planters in our coverage by up to 39%. This, along with some revision to our target price/earnings (P/Es) and rollover of target prices to end-2010 bump up our target prices by 2% to 45%. Singapore planters remain our top pick, followed by Indonesian and Malaysian planters. We like the Singapore planters because share liquidity is good and the pure CPO plays offer more compelling valuations than their regional peers. Furthermore, Singapore planters have been underperforming the market over the past month due to weak CPO prices, the deferment of the listing of Wilmar China and the sale of Indofood Agri shares by a major shareholder. For exposure to the regional plantation sector, we continue to recommend large-cap liquid planters. Our top picks in the region are Wilmar International (outperform, target price S$8.30), Sime Darby (trading buy, RM10.55), Astra Agro Lestari (outperform, Rp30,300), London Sumatra (outperform, Rp11,200), Indofood Agri Resources (trading buy, S$2.30), Sampoerna Agro (outperform, Rp 3,700) and Golden Agri-Resources Ltd (trading buy, S$0.57). Wilmar remains our top pick in the region due to its market leadership position in the edible oil sector, exposure to the growing China food market, strong business model and management. The stock continues to offer two potential re-rating catalysts in the form of the listing of its China operations and higher weighting in major indices due to improved liquidity. For a more leveraged play on CPO price, we recommend Indofood Agri and Golden Agri. For Indofood Agri, we are also expecting potential cost savings from the merger exercise and additional contribution from its sugar division in the coming year. In the case of Golden Agri, the potential earnings surprise will have to come from potential acquisitions. We like Indonesian planters for their superior production profile which is less susceptible to a prolonged drought. Given the higher target prices, we lift Astra Agro, Bakrie Sumatra and Lonsum to outperform from neutral while maintaining our outperform on Sampoerna Agro. We continue to rate the Malaysian plantation sector a neutral due to its premium P/E valuations against its regional peers. We believe that over time, the P/E rating for the Malaysian and Indonesian planters will narrow as Malaysian planters’ output growth is increasingly driven by their estates in Indonesia. However, we are upgrading Genting Plantations (target price: RM6.70) and Kuala Lumpur Kepong (RM16.15) to neutral as their valuations are less demanding following our earnings upgrade and the stocks are likely to perform in line with market in the event of a CPO price upswing. Sime Darby remains our top pick in view of the potential share price triggers of higher-than-expected cost savings, earnings-enhancing acquisitions, rising CPO price and stronger property sales. We are bumping up our FY2011-2012 earnings forecasts for IOI Corp by 4-7.3% in view of our CPO price upgrades. In line with our earnings revision, we up our target price from RM5.75 to RM6.05, still tagging a target forward P/E of 18 times. The stock remains a neutral. — CIMB Research, Nov 10 This article appeared in The Edge Financial Daily, November 11, 2009.\n",

      "Commentary by Ang Kok Heng THE 100-stock KLSE Composite Index (KLCI) was replaced by the FBM KLCI from July 6 onwards. As the new index replaced the old index, it commenced from the same level where the old index ended. This is made possible by choosing a base such that the market cap of the FBM KLCI divided by the new base equalled the KLCI. The old KLCI used the total market capitalisation or market value (denoted by MVold) of all the 100 component stocks divided by a base (denoted by Bold). MVold is computed by multiplying the number of stocks issued by the share price. For the closing value of the KLCI, the closing prices of component stocks were used. In this way, stocks with the higher number of shares will have a higher influence on the index for every 10 sen change in price. Looking from another angle, stocks with higher market capitalisation will have higher impact for every 1% change in price. In this way, KLCI is said to be size-weighted as bigger stocks having bigger market value will have stronger influence on the direction of the index. When the KLCI was instituted in 1977, the base was chosen such that the index commenced at 100 points. Over the years, due to changes in number of shares issued, the base was adjusted regularly. The new FBM KLCI does not use all the shares issued in computing the index. It only uses a portion of the shares issued depending on the freefloat in each of the component company. Prior to July 6, the KLCI closed at 1,108 points, and this is computed by the formula: 1,108 = MVold/Bold As the formula used to compute the index remains the same, the ratio of MV/B for the FBM KLCI should also be 1,108 after taking over from the KLCI. The new index, the FBM KLCI, has its own market value, MVnew, based on certain weightings of the 30 component stocks and the corresponding closing share prices such that, 1,108 = MVnew/Bnew A simple rearrangement shows that: Bnew = (MVnew/MVold) x Bold FBM KLCI — new benchmarkFrom July 6, 2009, onwards, FBM KLCI becomes the key benchmark representing Malaysian stock market. Everyday, commentators and newspapers worldwide will quote the performance of the FBM KLCI to denote the performance of the Malaysian market. When we look at other foreign bourses, we will also look at the performance of the key benchmark like the Hang Seng Index for Hong Kong, the Nikkei 225 for Japan, the ST Industrial for Singapore etc. Using a single benchmark to denote the performance of a market is a simple and convenient method to monitor a stock market. It provides the direction and relative performance of a market compared with other bourses. However, investors should always take note that a benchmark is as good as what it contains. For the new FBM KLCI, it is a much narrower 30-stock index compared with the predecessor, the KLCI, which encompassed a more extensive 100 stocks covering a wider range of sectors. Some of the sectors not included in FBM KLCI are construction, property, timber, IT etc. Dow is only a referenceOther than the FBM KLCI, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is also a rather narrow 30-stock index which has been in use for 113 years. While the FBM KLCI is size-weighted, DJ is just a simple average index where each of the 30 components has equal weighting. Despite of its less scientific method of computation, the DJIA is still widely followed by investors worldwide. Due to its lesser representation of the huge US market, the DJIA is only as good as a reference. For more serious analysis on the performance of New York Stock Exchange, a broader S&P 500 is always a more appropriate index to use as the later incorporates a wider 500 stocks and computed on size-weighted basis. Portfolio of assetsEvery investor has a portfolio of assets which will probably comprise cash/FD, shares, unit trusts, property etc. Each of the asset is denoted by A1, A2, A3, A4 etc and the percentage of each of the corresponding asset is denoted by w1, w2, w3, w4 etc. The value of the portfolio (P$) is represented by: P$ = A1 + A2 + A3 + A4 + ... The proportions in the different asset classes are denoted by: P% = w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + ... = 100% For a portfolio of shares, it may comprise several shares plus cash balance (C). The value of each of the share can be denoted by X1, X2, X3, X4 etc and the percentage of each of the corresponding asset is denoted by w1, w2, w3, w4. The value of the portfolio of shares (PX,$) is represented by: PX,$ = X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 + ... + C The portfolio breakdown in percentage term is shown as follow: P% = w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 + ... + wC = 100%, where wC denotes the percentage held in cash. The portfolio can be shown by way of sector such as consumer, industrial, trading services, plantation, construction, property etc where ws1 denotes the percentage invested in sector 1. P% = ws1 + ws2 + ws3 + ws4 + ... + wC = 100% Single stock portfolioThere are also some investors who believe in a stock and invest only in that stock. The stock so chosen must have gained a lot of conviction from the investor. It could be due to sentimental value, trust that the investor has on the stock or simply out of superstitious belief in providing luck to the investor from previous experience. There are many owners of listed companies who invest only in their own company as they do not trust the management of other listed companies. In terms of performance, this one-stock portfolio will behave quite differently from the benchmark index. The performance of this one-stock portfolio will depend entirely on the performance of the stock alone. Unless, the stock is a diversified blue chip, the share price could be very volatile. The risk of investing in a single stock is definitely high. Even a historically low beta stock could turn sour in the future due to unforeseen circumstances. For buy-and-hold strategy, single-stock portfolio does require close scrutiny by investors. This is possible if the investor is also the owner or a senior management of the company such that, he or she is able to keep track on every single movement of the company. Diversified portfolioMost investors have a diversified portfolio — having a variety of stocks accumulated over the years either by design or by default. Some investors know exactly what they want. They will choose the appropriate sectors and stocks to invest in. Some may have preference in certain sectors or to avoid certain sectors due to specific reasons. For example, Warren Buffett prefers consumer sector where it is easier to understand. It is not uncommon to see those involved in property-related trades prefer to invest in property stocks, those working in the estates prefer to buy plantation stocks etc. A well-diversified portfolio ideally should have stocks from different sectors especially those which are less correlated. Preferably in different business cycles — plantation (which depend on weather and price of palm oil), construction (which is highly dependent on the economy), stockbroking (which is linked to the vigour of the stock market) etc. Unfortunately, many investors end up with a long list of stocks inherited from the previous bull market. The so-called \"stuck\" shares probably make up a large portion of the portfolio. The stocks were purchased at high prices and the investors are unwilling to cut loss. This \"rojak\" portfolio will not help the investors to move forward. A review is needed to re-look at each of the stock in the portfolio objectively such that if a stock is needed to be sold then sell it. There is no point crying over spilt milk. Relying purely on luck to recover past losses is an unwise decision. Incorporate cash in portfolioWhile the FBM KLCI benchmark is an all-stock portfolio, the portfolio of an investor may not be fully invested at all time. Most people will have certain amount of cash not invested. But the portfolio’s cash portion of an investor is usually mixed with other savings. Without a segregated portfolio of equity investment, it will be difficult to determine the portfolio’s return and as such, there is no meaningful comparison with a benchmark. Merely looking at the performance of some of the stocks in the equity portion of a portfolio is difficult to conclude whether a person has done well in share investment. To have a proper performance comparison, it is necessary to put in the records of available cash for equity investment at the beginning of each year even though the cash is kept in savings or fixed deposit accounts. The share invested plus the allocated cash will form the portfolio at the beginning of each year. All sales proceeds and dividends received will be credited into the cash balance. Likewise, all purchases shall be debited from the cash balance. The total return of a portfolio is the amalgamation of return from share investment and interest/dividend income. In this arrangement, the total portfolio return will depend on the performance of the equities as well as the percentage invested in equities. Portfolio performanceThe performance of a portfolio Rp is the combined performance of each of the component (R) of the portfolio multiplied by the respective weight (w) where Rp = w1 x R1 + w2 x R2 + w3 x R3 + ... The return from the cash portion may be ignored for simplicity sake since present interest income is relatively small. In order for a portfolio to perform well, not only the stock must perform well, the weight must also be sufficient to provide a meaningful return. For example, a stock which gained 80%, but if an investor only invested 5% of his money in the stock, the contribution to the portfolio return is only 5% x 80% = 4%. On the other hand, an investor who invested 30% of his money in a stock which appreciated 40% will make 30% x 40% = 12% gain to the portfolio. The concept of assigning weighting to each stock or even sector is widely used by fund manager to monitor and analyse attributes to portfolio performance. For individual investors, it is also useful as the bottom line impact is the same. Performance comparisonIt is not uncommon to compare a portfolio return with a reference benchmark. The most convenient benchmark is the FBM KLCI which is also a fully-invested portfolio with no cash component and have different weights on each of the 30 component stocks. From the explanation above, it is now clear that the FBM KLCI may not provide meaningful comparison for most investors due to different sets of stock invested. While the FBM KLCI contain the biggest stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia, many individual investors will likely have a small portion invested in these stocks. While it is true that more money are invested in big-cap stocks and the return of big-cap stocks are important, retail investors are unlikely to be invested only in the big-cap stocks alone. Even most fund managers will not restrict themselves to the 30 stocks in the FBM KLCI. Unless a fund is an index fund linked to the FBM KLCI, most funds will have a much wider spectrum of stocks to invest in. As such, many fund managers find the FBM KLCI to be too narrow for benchmarking purposes. Use relevant benchmarkA portfolio should compare against a relevant benchmark depending on the objective of the fund and type of stocks to be invested in. Unfortunately, there is no perfect benchmark for most funds. The next alternative is to use the closest possible index as the reference index.Ang has 20 years’ experience in research and investment.

      "For many people, the main landmark in Taman Connaught would be the Taman Connaught Night Market in Jalan Cerdas. At 2km long, it is one of the longest night markets in Malaysia. It operates every Wednesday, when the stretch of road it occupies is closed to cars. Prior to the pandemic, it had more than 700 stalls. Located next to the East-West Link Expressway, Jalan Cerdas has other visible landmarks such as ikon Connaught Shopping Mall, UCSI University, Wisma UCSI, CMC Centre as well as McDonald’s Taman Connaught Drive-Thru. The most prominent of these is UCSI University, which occupies 20 acres along Jalan Puncak Menara Gading. According to its website, the campus has seven buildings for academic and residential purposes. The university has plans to build a five-star hotel, 12 levels of parking and student accommodation, administrative offices, restaurants, a ballroom and a clubhouse. Meanwhile, Wisma UCSI — located next to ikon Connaught Shopping Mall in Jalan Cerdas — houses UCSI College. There are many businesses along Jalan Cerdas (Photo by Low Yen Yeing/The Edge) Jalan Cerdas intersects several streets, namely Jalan Cergas, Jalan Mahir, Jalan Cerdas 1, Jalan Cerdik, Jalan Arif 1, Jalan Pintas, Jalan Puncak Menara Gading and Jalan Puncak Gading. These streets lead to the residential area of Taman Connaught and other parts of Cheras. Jalan Cerdas, together with Jalan Cerdas 1, Jalan Cerdik, Jalan Puncak Menara Gading and Jalan Puncak Gading, are commercial streets with shop­offices. There are many businesses and services here, especially branches of banks such as CIMB Bank, Public Bank, HSBC Amanah, Standard Chartered Saadiq, Alliance Bank, RHB Bank, Hong Leong Bank, AmBank as well as Maybank. There are also plenty of eateries, beauty salons, clinics, dental clinics and convenience stores in this part of Taman Connaught. Before the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and the subsequent Movement Control Orders, these commercial roads — especially Jalan Cerdas with its highway frontage — were busy. That translated into traffic congestion and a shortage of parking lots during the day. Many motorists resorted to parking their cars in the residential areas nearby to run their errands. Metro Homes Realty Bhd executive director See Kok Loong notes that this commercial area has one of the best locations in Cheras, as it faces the expressway. “Jalan Cerdas has maximum exposure and most corporations prefer this location; that’s why there are many major banks here. Jalan Cerdas 1 is an older development that usually houses transition shops. The Jalan Menara Gading 1 area, meanwhile, is a newer area and closer to UCSI University and UCSI College; therefore it attracts more lifestyle shops like cafés,” he says. “In 2020, there was a transaction of a 3.5-storey shopoffice (land size: 1,540 sq ft; built-up: 4,800 sq ft) in Jalan Cerdas at RM2.78 million. Also, three retail lots, sized from 1,300 to 2,800 sq ft, on the ground floor of ikon Connaught were sold at RM1,200 to RM1,800 psf.” As for the other streets, See notes that Jalan Menara Gading 1 has also registered several transactions. In 2019, a 3-storey shopoffice on the street (land size: 1,765 sq ft; built-up: 5,500 sq ft) was transacted at RM2.78 million. In 2018, there were five transactions, including a corner unit (land area: 3,500 sq ft; built-up: 9,200 sq ft) that was sold at RM5.1 million. “The future [of this area] is great with its visibility, alongside [the presence of] UCSI University and UCSI College. Also, the night market is a landmark. The popularity of the shops is not affected even with the high-tension cable running in front of them and there were hardly any empty shops there prior to the pandemic,” See concludes.\n",

Muhammad Farhan also confirmed that the lead counsel's illness was not related to Covid-19. Justice Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin then set March 28 and 29 as well as April 27 for the trial's continuation. Inland Revenue Board officer Syed Nasrul Fahmi Syed Mohamad was to be cross-examined by the defendants on Tuesday. He is the prosecution's seventh witness. Last Tuesday, Justice Muhammad had dismissed Shafee's bid to expunge parts of Syed Nasrul's witness statement. It was reported that according to Shafee's lawyers, Syed Nasrul had given \"legal opinions\" on some matters when he had the expertise to do so. They had also argued that the witness was said to have spoken about documents which were not produced as evidence in the court. Justice Muhammad had ruled that Shafee's lawyers had the avenue of cross-examination to determine the accuracy of his statements. Deputy Public Prosecutor Afzainizam Abdul Aziz represented the prosecutors on Tuesday. Shafee is on trial for two charges of receiving money derived from illegal activities amounting to RM9.5 million, through two cheques of RM4.3 million on Sept 5, 2013 and RM5.2 million on Feb 14, 2014 respectively, issued by former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak, which were allegedly deposited into the lawyer's CIMB Bank Bhd account. The senior lawyer is also facing two charges of engaging in transactions resulting from illegal activities, namely submitting incorrect tax returns and in violation of paragraph 113(1)(a) of the Income Tax Act 1967 for the financial years ended Dec 31, 2013 and 2014. The trial began on Sept 13, 2018.

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 21): CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s 92.5% indirectly-owned subsidiary, PT Bank CIMB Niaga Tbk (CIMB Niaga), posted an audited consolidated net profit of 4.1 trillion Indonesian rupiah in financial year 2021 (FY21), a 103.8% year-on-year (y-o-y) growth, translating into earnings per share of 164.5 rupiah. CIMB Niaga director Lani Darmawan said the results were encouraging with a double-digit return on equity (ROE), despite continued challenges due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. “We are optimistic that the recovery of economic and business activities across industries will continue in 2022. “Therefore, we are cautiously optimistic of a better financial performance in 2022, driven by loan and operating income growth, complemented by strong discipline in cost management,” he said in a statement and filing with Bursa Malaysia. He revealed the CIMB Niaga’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) and loan to deposit ratio (LDR) were strong at 22.7% and 74.4% respectively as at Dec 31, 2021. With total assets of 310.8 trillion rupiah as at Dec 31, 2021, CIMB Niaga maintained its position as Indonesia's second-largest privately owned bank by assets. CIMB Niaga also had total deposits at 241.4 trillion rupiah, with the current account savings account (CASA) ratio rising to 61.3%. “Current account and savings account grew by 35.1% (y-o-y) and 6.9% (y-o-y) respectively, driven largely by the bank’s continuous commitment to digital enhancement and customer experience,” he said. Meanwhile, total loans stood at 181.6 trillion rupiah contributed mainly from 9.2% y-o-y growth in the consumer banking segment. Mortgages grew by 9.1% year-on-year, while auto loans rose by 28.8% year-on-year.

      "APPLICATIONS will be open on Tuesday (Feb 15) for local employers to recruit foreign workers in the permitted sectors, including manufacturing, construction, agriculture, services, mining and quarrying and domestic helpers. This is welcome news for industries that have been hard pressed for foreign workers over the two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to the earlier hiring freeze by the government. Employers have also blamed the labour shortage for their losses. Hence, by allowing the hiring of foreign workers, employers say it would help to quicken the rate of recovery for businesses. Lee Heng Guie, executive director of the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia’s Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC), says while businesses have always supported the government’s call to reduce the over-dependence on foreign workers, the acute shortage of workers requires a quick resolution and pragmatic prioritisation to support the local economy towards recovery. “Business recovery efforts will be severely hampered if employers are not provided with the necessary workers, especially in sectors that are still dependent on foreign workers. Employers are very frustrated at not being able to engage the necessary workers as locals still shun the work performed by foreign workers,” he tells The Edge. Proponents of foreign labour argue that it makes sense to address the immediate issue at hand, given the risks of labour shortages hampering business growth and economic recovery. However, one has to ask if the country’s aspirations to move up the value chain and reduce the reliance on low-skilled foreign labour will be realised should hiring resume to what it was before. “The two-year pandemic would be a ‘wasted opportunity’ if industries were to revert to the use of foreign workers without considering plans to upgrade, adopt new technology and automate those processes that are performed by low-skilled foreign workers. Such industries should be encouraged to relocate to low labour cost countries in the region,” opines Sunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng, calling the over-dependence on foreign labour a long-standing structural problem that the country has been grappling with. He says more critical now is whether the country is using opportunities such as the large budget announced for the rebuilding of the economy to increase the rate and volume of quality investments, skilled job creation and production of high-value goods and services. “To the extent that the relaxation of the foreign worker intake does not jeopardise the industrial upgrading of the firms and industries in the long term, but contributes to raising the country’s income in the short term, then the ‘wasted opportunity’ would be a moot point,” he adds. The opportunity for change to take place is still there. People in the automation industry share anecdotal evidence of the changes that have been taking place among manufacturers as a result of the pandemic. “We have seen instances of manufacturers who have relied on 100% manual labour on their production lines prior to the pandemic now deciding to be fully automated. They are starting to see that machines are more consistent and result in fewer errors in the production process,” says an engineer in the automation field who asked not to be named. Policy-wise, there have been many proposals aimed at reducing the dependency on foreign labour. One such proposal is a multi-tier, market-based system for the hiring of foreign workers, which aims to allow the forces of demand and supply to determine the number of labourers needed. However, how successful this is in fulfilling its objective will depend on the implementation process. SERC’s Lee believes that the multi-tier levy, market-based system would help to reduce dependency on foreign labour but the plan, which was supposed to start on Jan 1, has been deferred to July 1. Since the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001-2005), the country has been talking about reducing its dependence on foreign labour. In the most recent two Malaysia plans — the 11th and the 12th — the government has placed a threshold to lower the number of foreign workers to not more than 15% of the workforce. Official statistics show that the authorities have managed to keep the number of foreign workers under the 15% threshold. In 2021, the official number of foreign workers stood at 1.1 million, making up about 7% of the total work force. However, labour activists say many foreign workers have fallen out of the official numbers because they do not have proper papers during the pandemic for a variety of reasons. The population of undocumented foreign workers in the country is believed to be large, with some saying that the number is equal to that of legal foreign workers, if not more. Notably, the number of foreign workers recruited in Malaysia is currently based on a set of conditions and on a ratio of local workers to foreign labour varied by sector. For example, in the manufacturing sector, the ratio of locals to foreign workers is between 1:3, 1:1 and 2:1, depending on whether it is an export-oriented industry, non-export-oriented industry or the electronics and electrical products industry. Sectors like plantation have a quota based on hectares while the services industry’s quota is based on the number of seats in the case of an eatery. However, one thing has been changed in the hiring process of foreign labour: Two weeks ago, Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin announced that the government will abolish the “special quota” for the recruitment of foreign workers. Now, all applications from employers will go through the ministry’s evaluation committee to determine the number of foreign workers eligible to be employed in accordance with the set terms and conditions. This was obviously met with mixed reactions, with some calling it a positive move while others feel that it could potentially derail the economic recovery. The Malaysian Employers Federation is one party that had expressed its concern about this abolishment, saying that the special quota system should continue as it provides businesses with a ready supply of labour to meet urgent needs. In contrast, the Federation of Manufacturers Malaysia (FMM) supports the move as it removes possible misuse and abuse of the system that results in excessive entries and the possibility of human trafficking issues. Lee also opines that moving away from special quotas on recruitment will help to ensure a consistent and transparent process for all sectors, without any special treatment, and weed out unproductive rent-seeking. “Doing away with the middle men in the recruitment of foreign workers, replacing them with a direct recruitment end-to-end system, will expedite the recruitment process while helping to lower the cost of hiring. There is a need for developing a ‘simple evaluate-process-submit’ online recruitment system, backed by a centralised database for direct recruitment of workers,” says Lee. It is worth noting that the Public Accounts Committee had in November 2020 issued findings on the control of foreign workers that highlighted many issues with the process, one of which was that the number of approvals for special applications was higher than that of regular applications. The bipartisan oversight committee deems the practice unhealthy, adding that “such practice does not meet the original purpose of the foreign worker quota application process”, which is to impose strict qualification screening. It is well known that the foreign worker recruitment process in Malaysia is complex. Employers frequently use private employment agencies to recruit foreign workers and many have called out the practices of such agencies as lacking in transparency. “About 95% of Vietnamese low-skilled workers in the manufacturing sector were recruited by private employment agencies and only 2% of experienced [foreign workers] were directly hired by employers. “Opaque private recruitment practices, sometimes coupled with complex worker deployment procedures set out by governments in labour-sending countries, often involve burdensome recruitment fees, causing or increasing the indebtedness of foreign workers. The transaction costs can be as high as US$2,700 (RM11,000) — equivalent to 10 months’ earnings in Malaysia — but can vary, depending on the origin of the workers,” says World Bank Group in a report titled “Who is Keeping Score?” that was released in April 2020. Malaysia also has bilateral government-to-government agreements with countries like Bangladesh in a bid to help reduce costs and improve transparency in foreign worker recruitment practices. However, the practices themselves continue to be shrouded in controversy. In 2018, recruitment from Bangladesh was frozen due to allegations of corruption and the involvement of a syndicate. Costs were not reduced nor was recruitment more transparent. In December last year, the two countries signed a new memorandum of understanding on the recruitment of workers from Bangladesh for employment in Malaysia. The contents of the agreement have not been disclosed. What is clear is that the foreign labour issue is a multidimensional one. With Malaysian employers needing for foreign labour to do jobs that locals won’t, even though many employers say that foreign labour is no longer “cheap” to hire, it feeds into a system of greed and exploitation. Raising the minimum wage Not too long after the announcement of the abolishment of special quotas, the Ministry of Human Resources also said that it is looking into raising the minimum wage this year — it could potentially be increased to no more than RM1,500 per month. Currently, the minimum wage stands at RM1,200. Businesses say that a RM300 rise is too steep given that they have just emerged from the pandemic, adding that such a rise could derail the economic recovery as businesses struggle to cope with additional costs. Yeah agrees that the notion that many small and medium enterprises would not be in a position to bear the RM300 rise in the minimum wage should be studied objectively. “While evidence in other countries shows that raising the minimum wage does not result in an increase in unemployment, its negative impact on Malaysia’s economic recovery cannot be ruled out, given the likely fragile financial condition of many firms due to the prolonged pandemic. “If the wage increase is too sharp, there could be business closures and few start-ups, and that may dampen the recovery momentum, hence the proposal by businesses for a staggered increase to provide some lead time for business planning to cope with the proposed minimum wage increase,” he says. However, Lee notes that the higher minimum wage would benefit 2.25 million workers in the country who are currently earning minimum wage. CGS-CIMB Research head of economics Ahmad Nazmi Idrus says the rise will benefit all workers to some degree, but cautions that a hike in wages without an increase in productivity is merely “inflationary”. “I think the idea is that a higher minimum wage provides the correct price signal for businesses to adopt better technologies. In a way, this will reduce foreign labour. “But the ultimate goal, in my opinion, is to raise the workers’ share of economic wealth. Take the gross domestic product by income released by the Department of Statistics Malaysia, for example. Sixty per cent of the wealth is held by the capital owners, while 37% is held by workers. This is low compared with other upper-middle income economies such as South Korea, at 54%,” he says.\n",

      "MISC Bhd Target price: RM7.75 BUY MAYBANK INVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (FEB 8): The long-expected winter season pickup in the dirty tanker market failed to materialise towards end-4Q21 as global Omicron-induced lockdown fears and softer Chinese imports limited tonnage demand. FY21 average spot freight rates for Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) and Suezmax (vessel class of 160,000 deadweight tonnage [DWT] capacity) saw their worst performance in a decade, while Aframax (vessel class of 80,000 to 120,000 DWT capacity) rates also hit an eight-year low during the period. Despite an encouraging current order book-to-fleet ratio of a manageable 8% to 14% for FY22-24, about a third of FY22 scheduled tanker deliveries are in the more than 60,000 DWT range and, thus, likely to offset any significant near-term rate increases as the market recovers from multi-year lows. Positively for MISC, its petroleum fleet has a favourable term-to-spot ratio that could provide some support for its 4Q21 performance. MISC’s spot charter exposure between its VLCC, Suezmax and Aframax vessels at end-3Q21 stood at 13%, 27% and 46% respectively. Thus, notwithstanding a 32.6% m-o-m decrease in December spot rates for VLCCs (MISC’s spot exposure is low), marginal m-o-m increases in Suezmax (+9.7%) and Aframax (+4.9%) rates could provide the necessary support as MISC’s spot exposure in these segments are more substantial. Noting that MISC performed admirably in 3Q21 despite tepid spot rates in both the LNG and petroleum segments, we expect the company to pull through an equally difficult 4Q21. With the Mero 3 floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) continuing to accrete positively to MISC’s bottom line, coupled with the recent decision by Opec+ to stick to its planned output bumps in the light of soaring global oil prices and record-low global crude inventories, we make no changes to our forecasts, pending better visibility post-4Q21 results. Our earnings forecasts and SOP-based target price of RM7.75 are maintained at this juncture. MISC currently trades at an attractive one-year forward PER of 13 times, has a robust balance sheet and offers a solid dividend yield of 5%. Hartalega Holdings Bhd Fair value: RM6 HOLD AMINVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (FEB 9): Hartalega’s 9MFY22 earnings of RM3.43 billion make up 83% of our and 96% of consensus FY22 forecast. We deem the earnings as below expectation due to a faster-than-expected decline in average selling price (ASP) and lower-than-expected utilisation rate. The company’s 3QFY22 earnings fell 72% q-o-q to RM259 million as ASP declined 40% q-o-q while sales volume slipped 17% q-o-q. The ASP decline is in line with the market price for gloves, which has passed its peak. As for sales volume, we gather that customers remain cautious in their purchase pattern due to declining ASP, coupled with logistic challenges caused by a global shipping container shortage. Hartalega announced a 14.8 sen dividend. The ex-date will be on Feb 23 with the payment date on March 9. Operationally, the company’s near-term focus is on improving its efficiency. For 4QFY22, we expect the utilisation rate to improve to 60%-65% from 3QFY22’s 52%. We have reduced the FY22, FY23 and FY24 earnings estimates by 28%, 4% and 2% respectively to RM3.23 billion, RM1.06 billion and RM888 million. British American Tobacco (M) Bhd Target price: RM9.96 REDUCE CGS-CIMB RESEARCH (FEB 9): Benefiting from the stay-at-home boredom and a lower supply of illicit cigarettes, BAT’s sales volume rose 9.7% y-o-y in FY21, leading to its turnover rising 13.9% y-o-y to RM2.6 billion. Although the market share of its flagship brand Dunhill in the premium segment increased 1.9ppt in FY21, BAT’s FY21 gross margin crept down to 25.6% from 25.8% in FY20. We suspect this was due to smokers down-trading from the mid-tier segment to the value-for-money (VFM) lines; BAT’s VFM market share rose 1.9ppt in FY21. BAT’s FY21 core net profit stood at RM285.1 million — 99% of our full-year forecast and 100% of Bloomberg consensus. BAT’s fourth interim dividend per share (DPS) of 27 sen brought its full-year DPS to 98 sen; we had expected 99 sen. The economic reopening, in our view, would leave smokers with less budget for their cigarettes since they would have other expenses to think about. It is telling that there was down-trading already in 4Q21, as reflected in BAT’s gross margin declining 80bps q-o-q to 25.6%. With the disruption in the global supply chain pushing up prices of daily necessities, we are concerned that the q-o-q margin squeeze in 4Q21 presages more down-trading in 2022F. We cut FY22-23F EPS by 4%-10% to reflect lower sales volume, more purchases of VFM cigarettes and higher marketing expenses for BAT’s vapes. YTL Power International Bhd Target price: 85 sen BUY HONG LEONG INVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (FEB 9): YTLP has entered into a share purchasing agreement with Australian Utilities for the disposal of: (i) 3,350 fully paid ordinary shares comprising a 33.5% stake in ElectraNet; (ii) 3,300 shareholder loan notes and 2,550 preferred loan notes issued by ElectraNet to YTLP; and (iii) 26,278,794 subsidiary shareholder loan notes issued by ElectraNet to YTLP, for a total sale consideration of A$1.03 billion (equivalent to RM3.06 billion). YTLP will recognise a gain on disposal of RM2.2 billion from the exercise, which is expected to be completed by end-2QCY22. We are overall positive on the exercise, which will allow YTLP to monetise its maturing asset investments. The cash proceeds will be used by YTLP for future investment purposes. Recently, YTLP revealed its new venture for a 500mw large-scale solar plant and acquisition of Dodid, a 12.5mw data centre operator in Singapore. It is also partnering Shopee for the application of a Malaysia digital banking licence. We remain positive on YTLP’s outlook with Seraya Power leveraging the recovering Singapore economy, Yes Communication leveraging increasing data demand in Malaysia and the commencement of Attarat Power in 2HFY22. We also expect sustainable dividend payout by the group.\n",

      "/article/farm-freshs-rm2-bil-ipo-valuation-appears-justified-say-analysts\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 18): Analysts say the RM2 billion valuation that Main Market-bound Farm Fresh Bhd is said to be looking at from its initial public offering (IPO) appears justified. The Khazanah Nasional Bhd-backed dairy producer, which is expected to be listed within the first quarter of the year, has yet to announce its IPO pricing. When contacted, Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong said a back-of-the-envelope calculation showed that Farm Fresh should be valued at about 60 times price-earnings (P/E) multiples based on the company’s profit after tax (PAT) of RM32.83 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 (FY21). Stripped off its one-off tax liability and penalty of RM25.71 million, Leong said Farm Fresh’s normalised PAT of RM58.54 million should value the company close to 30 times P/E multiple. Compared to its peers, Farm Fresh’s valuation is sitting somewhere between Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd and Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N), he said. The trailing 12-month price-earnings (TTM P/E) ratio was 53.6 times for Nestle, 25.1 times for F&N and 24.4 times for Dutch Lady, according to Bloomberg. Another analyst, who requested anonymity, expects Farm Fresh to be valued at mid-20 times P/E, on par with F&N and Dutch Lady’s valuation. Both analysts believe that Farm Fresh’s P/E valuation is justified, taking into account the company’s growth prospect and its leading market share in the ready-to-drink milk category. Leong said the company can ride on the population growth and enjoy the benefits of economic reopening, which is a catalyst to spur demand for its products. Meanwhile, another analyst believes Farm Fresh can continue to chart strong earnings growth going forward, which will be driven by its increasing herd size for dairy cattle. “One of the key drivers, which is their dairy cattle, has been increasing. As long as the company continues to allocate capex for farming, it should be able to continue to grow,” he said. He also observed that Farm Fresh’s products have gained popularity, given its shelf place in the retail stores has been expanding over the years. “Another [comparative] advantage for Farm Fresh is being an integrated dairy farming player, covering from (upstream) farming activity until (downstream) manufacturing, whereas its peer does not have in-house dairy farming and buying from others,” he added. Farm Fresh is Malaysia's second-largest player in the ready-to-drink milk category with a market share of 18%, and the third-largest in the yoghurt category with a market share of 11% for the first half of 2021, according to the company’s IPO draft prospectus posted on Securities Commission Malaysia website. The company operates five dairy farms in Malaysia and one in Australia, with a total herd size of 9,000 dairy cows and bulls. It also owns and operates two processing facilities in Malaysia, with the capacity to produce around 137 litres of finished goods annually and one processing facility in Australia, with the capacity to produce 84 million litres of processed milk annually. From FY19 to FY21, the company's PAT attributable to owners grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9% from RM27.4 million to RM36.2 million, while its revenue increased by a CAGR of 65.9% from RM178.2 million to RM490.5 million. Passing down additional costs to end-users Amidst the industry-wide practice of increasing commodity prices, analysts expect Farm Fresh to be able to pass down the additional costs to end-users and protect its margin, given customers’ \"stickiness\" towards its products. MIDF Research, in an emailed response, said as with any other consumer staple companies, inflation is an issue at the moment. “There could be potential headwinds for the sector as whole, with the rise in raw material prices due to inflation. In order to maintain margins moving forward, companies in the sector might have to resort to passing on the higher raw material prices to consumers and hike prices. \"However, with its innovative distribution business model such as the home dealers system, we opine that there is a possibility that the company will be adaptable to navigate future business challenges,” said the research firm. “While fresh milk is a staple in Malaysian households, an increase in the price of milk could result in the price-sensitive consumers resorting to more affordable brands, considering the concurrent increase in the price of other household items. However, we note that the wide-range of milk options that the company offers, which includes plant-based milk, will remain a strong factor to maintain customer stickiness, despite potential price hikes,” it added. Meanwhile, another analyst said Farm Fresh is also able to pass down the additional cost via innovation by adjusting the products pricing in the form of providing value added features to convince the customers to buy. Bloomberg, citing sources, reported last week that Farm Fresh had attracted almost 30 cornerstone investors, including Aberdeen Standard Investments and AIA Group Ltd, in a planned IPO. Great Eastern Life Assurance, Franklin Templeton Investment and some Malaysian state funds had also signed on, and the first-time share sale is expected to raise about RM1 billion, the report said. Farm Fresh’s IPO is set to be the country’s biggest since last June, when CTOS Digital Bhd, which runs a credit reporting agency, and its shareholders raised RM1.21 billion. On Tuesday (Feb 15), Farm Fresh signed an underwriting agreement with CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB IB), Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd, AmInvestment Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd for its IPO. The IPO — of up to 743.2 million shares in Farm Fresh — comprises an offer for sale of up to 520.2 million existing shares and a public issue of 223 million new shares. The 743.2 million IPO shares comprise an institutional offering of up to 687.4 million IPO shares and a retail offering of 55.7 million issue shares.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 17): Based on corporate announcements and news flow on Thursday, companies in focus on Friday (Feb 18) may include: Asia Poly Holdings Bhd, Bintai Kinden Corp Bhd, British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd, Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd, CIMB Group Holdings Bhd, CTOS Digital Bhd, Datasonic Group Bhd, Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd, Kobay Technology Bhd, Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd, Luxchem Group Bhd, Malaysian Genomics Resource Centre Bhd, MISC Bhd, Pharmaniaga Bhd and Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd. Asia Poly Holdings Bhd said it had spent 5.2% or RM7.52 million of its net assets to acquire 51.1 million shares or a 1.5% equity interest in Ta Win Holdings Bhd, bringing the former’s stake to 191 million shares or 5.59% of the latter’s total issued shares. Asia Poly said the 51.1 million Ta Win shares were purchased between Jun 10, 2021 and Feb 16, 2022, using internally-generated funds. The company said that it had acquired Ta Win shares for the purpose of investment. Bintai Kinden Corp Bhd has emerged as a substantial shareholder in Malaysian Genomics Resource Centre Bhd with a 5.03% stake, after acquiring 6.25 million shares. It said following the acquisition, Noor Azri Noor Azerai, who was redesignated as an executive director of MGRC effective from Feb 16, will oversee the business development, human resources and finance functions of the group. Azri Azerai said there are synergies in both companies that the firms intend to harness as Bintai Kinden diversified into the healthcare sector through the acquisition of Johnson Medical International Sdn Bhd (JMI) in November 2021. A new law will be introduced to ban smoking and possession of tobacco products, including vape, for the generation born after 2005, as a Generational End Game for smoking in the country, says Health Minister Khairy Jamaluddin. He said the introduction of the law would be able to reduce the future generation’s exposure to cigarettes and tobacco products as tobacco use is the leading cause of cancer and contributes to 22% of deaths due to cancer. The new law is expected to affect British American Tobacco (Malaysia) Bhd. Carlsberg Brewery Malaysia Bhd saw its net profit for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 rise 88.21% to RM71.42 million from RM37.95 million in the same period of the previous year, underpinned by higher profit contributions from its operations in Malaysia. Quarterly revenue increased 14.77% to RM542.33 million from RM472.54 million as the country entered the national recovery phase with more economic sectors reopened. The group declared a dividend of 46 sen per share. Meanwhile, Carlsberg Malaysia’s managing director, Stefano Clini said the group has allocated RM110 million of its capital expenditure to upgrade its brewery facilities, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year. CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s foreign shareholding increased to 24.9% in January 2022 from 24.7% in December 2021, the highest since May 2020, when the bank’s foreign shareholding stood at 25.6%. At a glance, CIMB’s foreign shareholding had risen steadily to the latest-report level at 24.9% in January 2022 from May 2021. CIMB’s foreign shareholding updates, which dates back as far as January 2010, show that the group’s foreign shareholding was at its highest at 42.9% in June 2011 while the lowest reading at 20.3% was recorded in May 2021. Credit-reporting agency CTOS Digital Bhd plans to raise RM270 million via a private placement of up to 166.67 million new shares at an indicative RM1.62 each to fund its acquisition of Juris Technologies Sdn Bhd and Business Online Public Co Ltd as well as other investments to further grow its business. The proposed placement is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022. Datasonic Group Bhd has bagged an RM50.12 million contract to supply the National Registration Department with MyKad, MyTentera and MyPOCA raw cards and consumables. The contract awarded by the Home Ministry spans a period of 12 months from Feb 15, and Datasonic is required to furnish an RM2.51 million performance bond to the Ministry. Hibiscus Petroleum Bhd’s net profit quadrupled to RM48.49 million for the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2021, from RM12.02 million a year earlier, on the back of improved operational performance and higher crude oil prices. Quarterly revenue rose 49.46% to RM284.4 million, from RM190.29 million previously. The oil & gas group did not declare a dividend for the quarter. It had sold 751,983 barrels of crude oil during the quarter at average realised prices between US$72.02 and US$75.15. Kobay Technology Bhd’s net profit more than doubled to RM14.52 million for the second quarter ended Dec 31, 2021, from RM5.95 million a year prior, on the back of its manufacturing segment’s strong performance. Revenue for the quarter jumped nearly three folds to RM92.83 million from RM35.8 million a year ago. Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd has reported a 60% plunge in its fourth quarter FY21’s net profit to RM218.67 million, compared with RM543.42 million on lower sales and normalisation of the average selling price (ASP) across its glove, technical rubber products and clean-room segments. Quarterly revenue declined 29.26% to RM924.56 million from RM1.31 billion a year prior. Kossan also declared a fourth interim dividend of 12 sen per share amounting to RM306.19 million, payable on April 22, with April 5 as the ex-date. Luxchem Corp Bhd’s net profit inched up 3.08% to RM16.59 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021, from RM16.1 million a year ago, on the back of a strong showing by its trading and manufacturing segments. Quarterly revenue rose 31.08% to RM288.69 million from RM220.23 million, due to higher sales from its manufacturing segment. The group declared a third interim dividend of one sen per share. MISC Bhd's net profit fell 16.96% year-on-year to RM461.7 million in the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 from RM556 million, dragged mainly by higher operating loss incurred by the marine and heavy engineering division and other adjustments. Revenue, however, rose 16.79% to RM3.09 billion from RM2.64 billion a year ago, underpinned by growth in revenue in all business segments. MISC declared a fourth dividend of 12 sen per share, taking the total dividend declared for the year to 33 sen. Pharmaniaga Bhd reported a net profit of RM85.48 million for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021, compared with a net loss of RM6.33 million in the same period of the previous year, on the back of higher revenue. Revenue grew 12.16% to RM711.72 million from RM634.58 million, mainly attributable to positive growth across the group's concession, non-concession and Indonesian businesses. The pharmaceutical group declared its fourth interim dividend of five sen per share, to be paid on April 5. Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd has filed a notice of appeal at the Court of Appeal to invalidate the High Court’s directive requiring the group to comply with Bursa Malaysia’s instruction to make public the fact-finding update on Serba Dinamik's special independent review. The review by Ernst & Young Consulting was on Serba Dinamik's financials.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 17): Credit-reporting agency CTOS Digital Bhd plans to raise RM270 million via a private placement of up to 166.67 million new shares at an indicative RM1.62 each to fund proposed acquisitions and investments to further grow its business. In a Bursa Malaysia filing on Thursday (Feb 17), CTOS said the placement shares are intended to be placed out to third party investors and the corporate exercise is expected to be implemented in a single tranche within six months from the date of approval from the bourse regulator for the listing and quotation of the placement shares on the Main Market of Bursa. \"The proposed placement is not expected to have any material effect on the earnings of the CTOS Digital group for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2022, save for the dilution in EPS (earnings per share) as a result of the increase in the number of CTOS Digital shares in issue pursuant to the proposed placement. \"As at the LPD (latest practicable date of Jan 31, 2022), there are 2.2 billion (2,200,000,000) CTOS Digital shares in issue. \"Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the proposed placement is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022,” CTOS said. According to CTOS, the placement of the new shares will enlarge its number of issued shares to 2.37 billion. CTOS, which has proposed to acquire a 49% stake in enterprise software specialist Juris Technologies Sdn Bhd for RM205.8 million, is also buying an additional 2.25% equity interest in Business Online Public Co Ltd (BOL), which provides business support services. According to CTOS, out of the RM270 million placement share proceeds, RM205.8 million will be used to finance the acquisition of the 49% stake in Juris while RM34.9 million has been allocated for the purchase of the additional 2.25% equity interest in BOL. Meanwhile, RM25.6 million has been set aside for \"acquisitions to be identified”. \"One of the company’s ongoing plans is to selectively pursue acquisitions and investments in companies as part of its growth strategy. CTOS Digital typically seeks assets that have direct cost and capability synergies with its digital solutions, enabling it to expand its digital solutions offering, achieve value chain integration for its existing segments and customers, and facilitate entry into new verticals. \"In the event the company is unable to fully utilise the proceeds allocated for acquisitions to be identified, such unutilised amount will be used for the working capital requirement of the group,” CTOS said. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd has been appointed as principal adviser to CTOS and joint placement agent for the proposed new share placement, according to CTOS. The other joint placement agents for the proposed share placement are CIMB Investment Bank Bhd, Credit Suisse Securities (M) Sdn Bhd, Credit Suisse (Singapore) Ltd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd, CTOS said. At 5pm on Thursday, CTOS’ share price closed two sen or 1.14% lower at RM1.73, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM3.81 billion. The stock saw 1.39 million shares traded.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 17): The Court of Appeal will decide on Feb 23 the appeal by former Tabung Haji chairman Datuk Seri Abdul Azeez Abdul Rahim against the High Court’s dismissal of his application to strike out his corruption and money laundering charges. Deputy public prosecutor Nik Haslinie Hashim informed Sessions Court Judge Azura Alwi that the parties involved were informed of the matter through a letter of notification from the Court of Appeal which they received last week. The case came up for mention on Thursday (Feb 17). Lawyer Amer Hamzah Arshad, representing Abdul Azeez, 55, confirmed the matter. Following which, Azura set March 18 for mention for the parties involved to inform the court on the appeal decision. The hearing of Abdul Azeez's case, which began on Aug 19, 2020 in the Sessions Court whereby seven prosecution witnesses had been called to testify, was adjourned pending the outcome of the appeal. Abdul Azeez is appealing against the High Court's dismissal of his application to strike out the three bribery charges involving RM5.2 million linked to road projects in Perak and Kedah, and 10 money-laundering charges involving a total of RM13.9 million which he was accused of receiving from Menuju Asas. High Court Judge Datuk Muhammad Jamil Hussin dismissed the application on grounds that all the charges made against Abdul Azeez were not defective and based on the provisions of law. The court also allowed an application by Abdul Azeez to stay hearing of his case pending the outcome of his appeal at the Court of Appeal. Abdul Azeez was alleged to have committed the offences at CIMB Bank, Jalan Tun Perak in Kuala Lumpur on Dec 8, 2010 and at Affin Bank, Puchong City Centre, Selangor, on June 13, 2017 and April 10, 2018. On the money laundering charges, Abdul Azeez was charged with committing the offences in the Klang Valley area between March 8, 2010 and Aug 30, 2018.\n",

      "AS shares in Malaysian construction companies dip to almost their lowest level since the pandemic started, many factors are at play to determine whether it is a good time to revisit the sector. CGS-CIMB Research analyst Sharizan Rozely says the market has priced in the uncertainties in the rollout of new infrastructure projects as well as the ensuing sector recovery. Hence, it may be a good time to take a position in undervalued stocks as the downside is limited, he tells The Edge. “Prior to GE14, many contractors were trading above one times book value. They are now undervalued across multiple valuation methods. “But investors need to be selective, choose companies with strong track records and good execution that could benefit from the potential rollout of large-scale projects such as the MRT3 Circle Line.” Similarly, MIDF Research suggests that “the risk and reward factors of the sector have been suitably priced in at this juncture”. “Currently, the Bursa Malaysia Construction Index is trading slightly below its average five-year forward price-earnings ratio (PER), at 10.6 times versus the long-term average of 11.6 times,” MIDF Research says in its email reply to The Edge. Rerating hinges upon clarity on mega projects However, any excitement in the sector still hinges on the prospects for the MRT3. The reason is that the government’s eagerness to kick-start economic growth by pump-priming the construction sector has not translated into the order books of listed construction players, MIDF Research says. “Select companies under our coverage saw a decline in cumulative order book value from the high of RM40.6 billion in 2018 to RM32.7 billion, or a 20% decline. “Among large caps on our coverage, only Sunway Construction Group Bhd (SunCon) managed to stem the decline [with] single-digit contraction, at 8%, in comparison to other companies. However, it is noteworthy that SunCon gets a lot of jobs from its parent, Sunway Group which has a big development business. “Perennial favourite Gamuda Bhd recorded a 25% decline in its order book value. [Around] 55% of Gamuda’s order book is derived from MRT2 jobs, which are already at 83% completion, [which is] slated to be in 2022. “We reasoned that such worrying trends put a question mark on companies’ earnings for the short- and medium-term horizon. We posit that only a continuation and revival of mega public infra projects will be the major catalysts for the sector moving forward,” MIDF Research says. Without MRT3, the short-term outlook is unexciting and valuation levels could remain stagnant, it adds. CGS-CIMB’s Sharizan says, “Every contractor in town is looking for new job opportunities. MRT3 has the highest probability of being relaunched by the government, but that depends on several approvals, including that of the Cabinet.” Investors could play on news regarding which sector has the highest probability of seeing any catalyst in the first half of this year, he adds. His top stock pick is Gamuda (target price: RM3.88) for its advantage over other bidders for the MRT3 underground package as the incumbent for MRT1 and MRT2. He also has “buy” calls on IJM Corp Bhd (TP: RM2.17) as it is a contender for the Tier 1 civil works packages of MRT3, owing to its strong balance sheet that could help it meet the private funding requirement. East Malaysia growth story intact Meanwhile, East Malaysian construction players’ order book replenishment and earnings prospects are seen to be bright in the medium to long term, with Sabah and Sarawak having received the bigger share of the federal budget development expenditure allocation in 2022 of RM5.2 billion and RM4.6 billion respectively. In addition, the numerous upgrading works of potentially more than 1,800 projects could provide a fillip to demand for cement, concrete and steel pipes, likely benefiting the region’s sole cement manufacturer Cahya Mata Sarawak Bhd (CMS), MIDF Research says. On the RM15 billion Phase 1 Sabah Pan Borneo Highway, the research house sees the new Private Finance Initiative (PFI) approach to benefit players in East Malaysia with a strong balance sheet to stomach the financing requirement. One of them is Hock Seng Lee Bhd (HSL). “It is the only company which owns a full range of tunnel boring machines for sewer networks in East Malaysia,” MIDF Research points out. The research house’s top picks include Gamuda (TP: RM3.63), CMS (TP: RM1.62) for its strong position in East Malaysia, and SunCon (TP: RM1.80) for its defensive and quality earnings outlook on the back of an order book of more than RM4 billion which will last three years. Other risks could cap upside Other research houses have maintained their “neutral” calls on the sector, with risks expected to persist across several fronts. Despite a surge in contract awards for the industry in 4Q2021, HLIB Research remains neutral on the sector “as fluidity of looming elections could weigh on sector sentiment, with investors adopting a wait-and-see approach”. “Our expectations are for a recovery in private sector opportunities and the ongoing rollouts of existing projects like the East Coast Rail Link, Pan Borneo Highway Sabah and Sarawak, the Johor-Singapore Rapid Transit System and Central Spine Road to support job flows in 2022,” it says in a Jan 10 note. “Sector valuations are on the lower end at 12.9 times forward PER (five-year average) and 0.65 times price-to-book (P/B) ratio (-1 standard deviation on five-year range). “Recent news flow on critical projects like MRT3 is encouraging but we remain cautious on the timeline and overall sector earnings execution amidst the ongoing virus spread.” The research house has “buy” calls on SunCon (TP: RM1.77) owing to its strong balance sheet, extensive track record of infrastructure projects and strong support from Sunway Group, as well as Kimlun Corp Bhd “for its solid order book, decent job visibility and niche exposure to MRT3, alongside attractive six times PER and 0.35 times P/B ratio”. Maybank IB Research, in its December 2021 note, writes that the “continuous rise in material cost and labour shortages will cut into margins for jobs already secured”. Covid-19 risks also remain, while stalled order book replenishment from delayed major infrastructure project rollouts may lead to an “earnings cliff” in 2023/24 as existing projects are completed, it adds. Nonetheless, the bank-backed research house’s preferred buys include IJM (TP: RM2.20) and Gamuda (TP: RM4), as their strong balance sheets will enable them to take on private sector funded projects anticipated under the public-private partnership (PPP) 3.0 model, which could come into the picture this year. It also has a “buy” call on CMS (TP: RM1.68). Other analyst picks in the construction sector include Gabungan AQRS Bhd, WCT Holdings Bhd and YTL Corp Bhd.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 16): An owner of a travel agency on Wednesday (Feb 16) pleaded not guilty in the Sessions Court to five charges of engaging in money laundering involving RM1.15 million. Norani Ismail, 66, was charged with transferring RM1.15 million, believed to be proceeds of unlawful activities, from a current account of Malayan Banking Bhd belonging to her company into a Maybank Bhd current account and a Malayan Banking Islamic Bhd savings account belonging to one of her children, her Malayan Banking and CIMB Bank Bhd current accounts as well as a Hong Leong Bank Bhd current account belonging to her company. She is alleged to have committed the offences at the Bukit Bintang branch of Malayan Banking here between Jan 25 and Oct 3, 2019. The charges were framed under Section 4 (1)(b) of the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001, which provides an imprisonment for up to 15 years and fine of not less than five times of the amount obtained from unlawful activities, or RM5 million, whichever is higher upon conviction. Earlier, deputy public prosecutor Norazihah Asmuni applied for the money laundering case to be jointly heard with another case facing the woman at the Shah Alam Sessions Court because it involved the same transaction. Judge Ahmad Kamar Jamaludin allowed the case to be transferred to the Shah Alam Sessions Court and allowed the bail of RM15,000 set by the court to be applied.

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 16): RHB Investment Bank Bhd has maintained a ‘buy’ call on Duopharma Biotech Bhd with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.91 per share after registering sturdy numbers for financial year 2021 (FY21). The research house said Duopharma reported a core net profit of RM67 million, at 97% of its full-year estimates with topline growing 12% year-on-year (y-o-y), sustained by the continued robust demand for consumer healthcare products and recovery in the public health sector. In a research note on Wednesday (Feb 16), RHB said despite the depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar, the company continued to record resilient gross margins for the fourth quarter 2022 (4Q22). “We believe its long-term earnings growth prospects remain bright, on the back of its efforts to improve product offerings while venturing into high-value therapies,” it shared. Meanwhile, CGS-CIMB reiterated a ‘hold’ call on Duopharma with an unchanged TP of RM1.60. The research house said Duopharma’s FY21 results were in line with its expectation but 4Q21 core earnings per share (EPS) fell 10% y-o-y due to lower margins. CGS-CIMB said y-o-y local sales grew a healthy 8.1% y-o-y, thanks to continued good take-up of its consumer healthcare (CHC) products, such as immunity-boosting products which is 20% to 25% of total sales and recovery in public sector sales. Nonetheless, it said local revenue eased 14% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), mainly due to seasonally weaker public sector demand while 4Q21 export revenue, which is 5% of total, remained tepid at RM8 million due to Covid-19-led logistical challenges. However, CGS-CIMB said it forecasts a better FY22 performance for Duopharma and raised FY22 core EPS by 11% to factor in potential one-off RM10 million tax savings of reinvestment allowance upon the commissioning of its K3 plant targeted for FY22. “We now see core EPS growing a strong 19% in FY22 from private/public sector sales growth and tax savings, before moderating to 4% in FY23 due to some softening in CHC sales growth post-Covid-19 and lack of tax savings, and then resuming to 10% in FY24,” it added.

      "“We’re looking to raise, actually, in excess of RM400 million to fund the expansion and growth [of ADE].” — Capital A’s co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Tan Sri Tony Fernandes KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 15): Capital A Bhd (formerly known as AirAsia Group Bhd) has said that it is in the midst of raising more than RM400 million to build the country's biggest integrated maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) facility in Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). The megaproject will be undertaken by its wholly-owned engineering arm, Asia Digital Engineering (ADE). The fundraising exercise comes within two months after the aviation group completed its rights issue last December that raised RM974.5 million. Prior to that, the group, which has slipped into PN17 status, also raised RM336.48 million from the private placement of new shares and received a RM500 million credit facility from Danajamin in 2021. Capital A's co-founder and chief executive officer (CEO) Tan Sri Tony Fernandes said that the investment holding group would support the growth of ADE. \"We're looking to raise, actually, in excess of RM400 million to fund the expansion and growth [of ADE],\" Fernandes was quoted by Reuters as saying at the 2022 Singapore Airshow on Tuesday (Feb 15). Capital A announced that ADE will be building a 380,000 sq ft integrated MRO facility in KLIA in mid-2022 and it is expected to be completed within two years. The statement highlighted that ADE's new facility will make it one of the largest in the region as it will be able to provide heavy MRO services for up to 14 commercial aircraft at any time. Turnaround from PN17 status remains in progress Capital A was classified as a PN17 company after Bursa Malaysia rejected its application to extend the 18-month relief period that ended on Jan 7. The reason for its slide into the PN17 status was due to the negative shareholders' equity position of RM3.2 billion as at its third quarter ended Sept 30, 2021 (3QFY21), which was a result of a nine-quarter net loss streak beginning from 3QFY19, even before the pandemic hit in 2020. Nonetheless, Capital A has gone through many rounds of fundraising exercises, which saw it raise RM2.6 billion, as well as a wholesale change of its corporate strategy from an aviation group to an investment holding group. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd's analyst Samuel Yin Shao Yang in a note on Jan 17 highlighted that the cause for the PN17 status was due to Capital A's balance sheet, not its cash flow. Yin added that the RM2.6 billion raised by Capital A could carry it through FY22 when compared against the group's balance sheet position. Maybank rated Capital A as a \"buy\", with a target price (TP) of RM1.31. In a note on Jan 14, UOB Kay Hian Malaysia's analyst Jack Goh also believed that Capital A could last through FY22 and FY23, provided that its monthly operating cash burn remained constant around RM68 million to RM 75 million. Goh rated the investment holding group with a \"hold\" call and a TP of 76 sen. However, CGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd's analyst Raymond Yap did not think Capital A was out of the woods yet, rating it a \"sell\" and the lowest TP of nine sen among all 18 analysts covering Capital A, according to Bloomberg data. In a note on Feb 10, Yap expected Capital A's negative shareholders' equity situation to worsen from RM3.2 billion as at 3QFY21 to RM5.6 billion by the end of FY22 while the diversification of Capital A into digital businesses remained \"in the investment stage where they may consume significant amounts of cash resources, which is also because they are competing against established and well-funded competitors\". To recap, Capital A has been in the red since FY19 as it reported net losses of RM283 million and RM5.89 billion for FY19 and FY20, respectively. For the cumulative nine months ended Sept 30, 2021, Capital A managed to narrow its net loss to RM2.23 billion from RM2.66 billion in the same period of FY20, despite its revenue falling by a third to RM1.02 billion from RM2.97 billion. Capital A's shares were unchanged at 63 sen on Tuesday's market close, giving the investment holding group a market capitalisation of RM2.62 billion based on 4.16 billion outstanding shares. The group's share price has declined 18 sen or 22.22% since the beginning of 2022. To receive CEO Morning Brief please click here.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 15): CGS-CIMB Securities Sdn Bhd has raised its forecast for Malaysia's inflation to 2.5% year-on-year in 2022 from 2.2% previously. In a research note on Tuesday, the brokerage firm said the current forecast includes the adjustments to more persistent commodity prices as well as recent developments including price controls and higher electricity tariffs for non-domestic users. It said the government decided to implement a surcharge of 3.7 sen per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for February to June 2022 from a rebate of two sen per kWh in July 2021 for non-domestic users while prices for domestic users remain unchanged. CGS-CIMB Securities said the firm will revise its inflation forecast higher if its assumption of milder prices in the second half of 2022 does not materialise as the commodity price outlook remains a major factor. \"Our analysis of the impact of price movements on the economy shows that global price shocks do trickle down to the consumer price index,\" it said. However, it said private consumption may not be negatively affected by positive price shocks while a rise in interest rates following higher inflation depends on whether inflation is coming from the demand or the supply side. The brokerage firm said the economy is still running below its pre-pandemic levels, indicating that the demand-pull pressure on inflation is still relatively weak. CGS-CIMB Securities said the multitude of measures announced by the government could mitigate the global price fluctuations seeping into the domestic side. The brokerage firm said it projects little risk of inflation disrupting the economic recovery and expects Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) to continue to focus on domestic growth, particularly the improvement in private consumption and the labour market. It said BNM is expected to raise interest rate twice in the second half of this year, comprising 25 basis points each time. The brokerage firm said the government measures are balancing out the global price pressure and it believes that there is limited risk of runaway inflation this time around. It said the pressure will continue to build up over the next several months as the underlying factors remains fully at play. \"In fact, we are unlikely to see significant easing of price pressure on the global basis in the near term. Some easing of supply chain issues and the subsequent lower freight costs will provide some offset but we do not expect much relief,\" it said. It added that delays in foreign worker intake may continue to exert pressure on wages as companies try to entice workers to meet the high demand and in return, companies may transfer these costs to consumers.\n",
      "/article/bumi-armada-shares-rally-oil-prices-hit-sevenyear-high\n",
      "THE share price of oil and gas player Bumi Armada Bhd hit a 52-week high of 55 sen last Monday, as oil crossed the US$90 per barrel mark for the first time in seven years. The stock has appreciated 17% year to date, in tandem with the 18% increase in Brent crude oil, which hit US$91 per barrel last Monday — the highest level since October 2014. Higher oil prices positively impact Bumi Armada as they act as a catalyst for investments, which in turn provide opportunities in terms of new projects for the company’s core business, floating production storage and offloading vessels, or FPSOs. It has a fleet of seven FPSOs (four wholly owned and three jointly owned), a liquefied natural gas floating storage unit and a partially owned FPSO under construction. Bumi Armada’s offshore marine services (OMS) segment also gets a boost from the higher oil prices as it means new exploration activity, which creates demand for its assets. But the OMS fleet comprises ageing ships, which are not competitive. However, Bumi Armada is exiting the OMS segment to focus on the more lucrative FPSO business. Towards this end, it has announced the disposal of four ice class vessels (ships that operate in icy weather) to Russian oil and gas giant PJSC Lukoil for US$44.5 million (RM186.6 million). Bumi Armada is slated to utilise US$38 million of the proceeds to pare down its borrowings and US$6.5 million for working capital purposes. Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research says of the disposal, “We are positive on this development as it would be earnings accretive to Bumi Armada in its financial year ending Dec 31, 2022 (FY2022) and beyond, and the bulk of the proceeds will be used to further strengthen its balance sheet … Based on our calculations, this would reduce the group’s net debt from RM6.5 billion to RM6.3 billion, and net gearing ratio from 1.71 times to 1.66 times.” HLIB Research has a “buy” call on Bumi Armada, with a target price of 84 sen, an upside of 53% to its last traded price of 55 sen last Thursday. “We think Bumi Armada is highly compelling, given its foothold in the floating production and operation business, which provides steady recurring income, coupled with speedy enhancement to its debt profile. We are convinced that [the group] should see clearer skies ahead with its ongoing efforts to continue improving its balance sheet and cash flow management,” says the research house. HLIB is one of 12 brokerages with a “buy” call on the stock. RHB Investment Bank is another, with a target price of 62 sen. “We expect its FY2022 to FY2023 recurring earnings to improve by 6% to 8% with the absence of losses from these [ice class ship] companies, and we expect its balance sheet to improve on the back of healthy operating cash flow, led by stable FPSO operations and continuous asset monetisation,” it says in a note published last month. Bumi Armada reported a net profit of RM456.06 million on revenue of RM1.72 billion for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2021 (9MFY2021), compared with a net loss of RM18.58 million on revenue of RM1.72 billion in the previous corresponding period. The higher profitability was the result of lower finance costs, higher share of results from joint ventures and higher operating income during the year, as well as the absence of impairment losses on vessels that were recognised in 2020. In a note following the release of the group’s financial results in November last year, Maybank Investment Bank says Bumi Armada’s turnaround story is beginning to gain traction. “Improving cash flows and monetising non-core assets are its key performance indicators. It will continue to de-gear and seek redeployment opportunities for its fleet,” says the investment bank. In 2019, Bumi Armada’s 30:70 joint venture with India-based Shapoorji Pallonji Group — Shapoorji Pallonji Bumi Armada Godavari Pte Ltd — was awarded a nine-year FPSO charter contract worth US$2.1 billion by India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd. However, the construction of the FPSO in the east coast city of Kakinada, termed the 98/2 project, has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. CGS-CIMB Research, which has a “hold” call on Bumi Armada, says: “We have included the contribution of FPSO 98/2 into our target price and earnings forecast for 3Q2022, [however] these may need to be deferred … Given the uncertainties, we apply a new 10% discount to the sum of parts of 57 sen to derive our target price of 51 sen.” UOB Kay Hian, in a note published last month, also maintains its “hold” call on the stock, with a target price of 49 sen. “Despite the higher oil prices, we do not see any near-term catalysts for now until the subsea segment, which was the fundamental drag for many years, manages to secure material contracts,” it says in the note. Bumi Armada counts tycoon T Ananda Krishnan as its largest shareholder, with a 34.8% stake. Its share price had appreciated 59% over the past year to close at 55 sen last Thursday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM3.25 billion.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 15): Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research has maintained its “overweight” rating of the media sector and said that the local advertising space is undergoing a consolidation phase where advertisers are no longer relying on either digital or traditional media but will adopt an omnichannel approach to widen their reach as well as to mitigate regulatory and policy change risks. In a note on Tuesday (Feb 15), the research house said the initial presence of Facebook and Google had disrupted the local advertising and media landscape as they took up an estimated 80% of digital advertising expenditure (adex) in Malaysia which cannibalised some of the traditional media’s share. “Advertisers preferred Google and Facebook due to low cost (an ad can be run at less than RM10), ease of setting up an ad, targeted audience reach and superior customer analytics. “Nonetheless, we believe that the gap in the ROI (return on investment) from ad spend on Facebook and Google versus the traditional media is narrowing. The gap started to narrow when Malaysia introduced a 6% digital tax on foreign digital service providers on Jan 1, 2020. The digital tax raised the cost of advertising on Facebook and Google by 6%,” said HLIB. The research house also noted that Facebook’s user base is likely to decline due to stiff competition from other platforms, while a change in Apple’s privacy policy enabling users to opt out of tracking for advertising purposes made Facebook a less attractive advertising medium. “The impending phasing out of third-party cookies by Google and other potential policy change risks arising from increasing demand for better user privacy are headwinds to advertising platforms that utilise user data for ad targeting, including Facebook, YouTube and Google Display Network. As a result, advertisers are also pivoting and looking for alternative advertising solutions.” Meanwhile, local media players are also improving the ROI from advertising spend on their platforms, noted HLIB. “For example, Media Prima [Bhd has] integrated all its media assets under one channel to offer advertisers an advertising solution that has a wider reach across its different media assets to the targeted audience at a lower cost. Astro [Malaysia Holdings Bhd], on the other hand, launched addressable advertising in December 2021 that serves more targeted ads according to its customers’ profiles for video on demand on Astro GO, Ultra and Ulti boxes. In CY22 (calendar year 2022), addressable advertising will be rolled out on linear TV, enabling Astro to air different advertisements to different household segments during the same time slot, providing more targeted reach to advertisers. “We maintain 'overweight' on the sector, premised on a brightening outlook and undemanding sector valuations,” it said. HLIB said with inflationary pressure on raw material cost compressing the operating margin of sectors such as consumer and manufacturing, investors who look for inflation-resistant havens could find the media sector (especially Astro and Media Prima) to be appealing as their cost base (content cost) is largely unaffected by inflationary pressure. “Furthermore, the net cash positions of Media Prima and Star Media Group Bhd and the generous dividend yield from Astro also provide a decent buffer against the downside to share prices,” it said. Separately, CGS-CIMB Securities said the traditional media’s adex prior to the discounting factor rose 20.3% year-on-year (y-o-y) to RM4.9 billion in 2021, citing Nielsen Malaysia. In a note on Monday, the research house said the figure was only 5% below pre-Covid-19 pandemic levels of 2019, driven by free-to-air broadcasting which made up nearly three-quarters of 2021’s adex. “We are of the view that entertainment and visual-based media would remain advertisers’ choice going forward. “We maintain 'add' on Astro and Media Prima,” it said. CGS-CIMB said it expects Media Prima to emerge from a core net loss in CY21 and register y-o-y earnings per share growth of 18.1%-43.6% in CY22-23. “Catalysts are ad spend rising higher than expected and the 15th general election possibly taking place in CY22, boosting the ad market. “Downside risk: unfavourable socio-economic conditions hampering ad spend and subscription revenue,” it said.\n",

      "For many people, the main landmark in Taman Connaught would be the Taman Connaught Night Market in Jalan Cerdas. At 2km long, it is one of the longest night markets in Malaysia. It operates every Wednesday, when the stretch of road it occupies is closed to cars. Prior to the pandemic, it had more than 700 stalls. Located next to the East-West Link Expressway, Jalan Cerdas has other visible landmarks such as ikon Connaught Shopping Mall, UCSI University, Wisma UCSI, CMC Centre as well as McDonald’s Taman Connaught Drive-Thru. The most prominent of these is UCSI University, which occupies 20 acres along Jalan Puncak Menara Gading. According to its website, the campus has seven buildings for academic and residential purposes. The university has plans to build a five-star hotel, 12 levels of parking and student accommodation, administrative offices, restaurants, a ballroom and a clubhouse. Meanwhile, Wisma UCSI — located next to ikon Connaught Shopping Mall in Jalan Cerdas — houses UCSI College. There are many businesses along Jalan Cerdas (Photo by Low Yen Yeing/The Edge) Jalan Cerdas intersects several streets, namely Jalan Cergas, Jalan Mahir, Jalan Cerdas 1, Jalan Cerdik, Jalan Arif 1, Jalan Pintas, Jalan Puncak Menara Gading and Jalan Puncak Gading. These streets lead to the residential area of Taman Connaught and other parts of Cheras. Jalan Cerdas, together with Jalan Cerdas 1, Jalan Cerdik, Jalan Puncak Menara Gading and Jalan Puncak Gading, are commercial streets with shop­offices. There are many businesses and services here, especially branches of banks such as CIMB Bank, Public Bank, HSBC Amanah, Standard Chartered Saadiq, Alliance Bank, RHB Bank, Hong Leong Bank, AmBank as well as Maybank. There are also plenty of eateries, beauty salons, clinics, dental clinics and convenience stores in this part of Taman Connaught. Before the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and the subsequent Movement Control Orders, these commercial roads — especially Jalan Cerdas with its highway frontage — were busy. That translated into traffic congestion and a shortage of parking lots during the day. Many motorists resorted to parking their cars in the residential areas nearby to run their errands. Metro Homes Realty Bhd executive director See Kok Loong notes that this commercial area has one of the best locations in Cheras, as it faces the expressway. “Jalan Cerdas has maximum exposure and most corporations prefer this location; that’s why there are many major banks here. Jalan Cerdas 1 is an older development that usually houses transition shops. The Jalan Menara Gading 1 area, meanwhile, is a newer area and closer to UCSI University and UCSI College; therefore it attracts more lifestyle shops like cafés,” he says. “In 2020, there was a transaction of a 3.5-storey shopoffice (land size: 1,540 sq ft; built-up: 4,800 sq ft) in Jalan Cerdas at RM2.78 million. Also, three retail lots, sized from 1,300 to 2,800 sq ft, on the ground floor of ikon Connaught were sold at RM1,200 to RM1,800 psf.” As for the other streets, See notes that Jalan Menara Gading 1 has also registered several transactions. In 2019, a 3-storey shopoffice on the street (land size: 1,765 sq ft; built-up: 5,500 sq ft) was transacted at RM2.78 million. In 2018, there were five transactions, including a corner unit (land area: 3,500 sq ft; built-up: 9,200 sq ft) that was sold at RM5.1 million. “The future [of this area] is great with its visibility, alongside [the presence of] UCSI University and UCSI College. Also, the night market is a landmark. The popularity of the shops is not affected even with the high-tension cable running in front of them and there were hardly any empty shops there prior to the pandemic,” See concludes.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 22): Analysts on Tuesday reiterated their \"buy\" calls on Guan Chong Bhd as they see better growth for the company underpinned by its overseas expansion. RHB Research analyst Lee Meng Horng said in a note that he expects a better performance for Guan Chong into the financial year ending Dec 31, 2022 (FY22) on pent-up global demand, growing contributions from overseas operations, and expansion drives. “The current below-peer valuation provides a buying opportunity to a valued and stable consumer name like Guan Chong with an increasing global footprint,” he said. He kept his target price (TP) for Guan Chong at RM4, which indicated a potential upside of 31% based on its closing price of RM3.05 on Monday. “At an attractive 13 times of FY22 price-earnings ratio (PER), we believe investors should position into a stable consumer product name like Guan Chong, given its unique global presence and growth angle from international expansions, building on its current earnings base secured by its forward selling mechanism,” he said. He also noted that Guan Chong’s fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 (4QFY21) concluded on a high with FY21 earnings of RM156 million coming within his expectation. “The strong quarter-on-quarter (+48.7%) and year-on-year (+9.5%) quarterly earnings were aided by both topline and margin improvements,” he said while maintaining its earnings forecast. In a separate note, AmInvestment Bank analyst Muhammad Afif Zulkaplly also said he likes Guan Chong for its overseas expansion plan prospects, allowing it to tap into the European market. “The stock is trading at an undemanding valuation of 13 times PER 2022 earnings per share compared to Bursa Malaysia Consumer Product Index’s historical average of 19 times PER,” he said. He remained optimistic on Guan Chong’s medium-to-longer term outlook with its future growth underpinned by: i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) yield improvement as impact of living income differential (LID) subsides; ii) recovery of cocoa butter’s average selling price (ASP) to be bolstered by demand revival for upmarket chocolates; and iii) its overseas expansion plan. He also said Guan Chong’s 4QFY21 core net profit of RM51.2 million is above his expectation, and the outperformance is mainly attributed to stronger sales volume during the quarter. He made no changes in its earnings post-results. He maintained a fair value of RM3.40 on Guan Chong, based on unchanged PER of 15 times of 2022 EPS of 22.8 sen. At 12.04pm, Guan Chong fell 17 sen or 5.57% to RM2.88, valuing the group at RM3.12 billion.

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 19): The ringgit is expected to trade within a tight range of between 4.18 and 4.19 against the US dollar next week. Bank Islam Malaysia Bhd chief economist Mohd Afzanizam Abdul Rashid said the geopolitical risks and concern over a sharp increase in the US Federal Reserve funds rate would dictate the currency market's sentiments next week. “Uncertainties over the conflict in Ukraine continue to hog the limelight as market participants are weighing in the latest developments and there also seems to be mixed vibes coming from US President Joe Biden’s administration and Russia. “Despite that, back home, Malaysia’s exports in January continued to record a double-digit growth of 23.5% and similarly imports grew by 26.4%,” he told Bernama. He said the higher exports indicated that Malaysia benefited from improving global demand, while the double-digit expansion in imports showed that domestic activities became more lively with imports of capital and consumption goods rising 37.7% and 32% respectively in January. Mohd Afzanizam said it appeared Malaysia should be on track to register respectable growth this year given that both engines — external and domestic demand — will provide a boost to overall gross domestic product growth. The ringgit should be viewed positively but not in the meantime, he said. Meanwhile, RHB Research in its note said while it is difficult to forecast how the Ukraine-Russia tensions would evolve and what is going to be the endgame, its view is that these geopolitical risks would linger for much of the first half of 2022. “The US dollar against Asian currencies is likely to have one more leg up in the first quarter before depreciating till end-2022,” it said. On a weekly basis, the ringgit rose versus the US dollar to 4.1845/1870 from 4.1885/1910 a week ago. The local currency traded mostly lower against other major currencies on a Friday-to-Friday basis. The ringgit slipped against the Singapore dollar to 3.1149/1170 from 3.1148/1169 a week earlier, eased against the British pound to 5.7001/7035 from 5.6783/6817, and depreciated vis-a-vis the Japanese yen to 3.6340/6361 from 3.6089/6111.

      "/article/analysts-kossans-earnings-forecasts-revised-down-lower-sales-and-average-selling-price\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 18): Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd's earnings projections have been lowered on lower sales and average selling price (ASP) outlook, despite its net profit for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 (4QFY21) coming within expectations, said analysts. The earnings downgrade came after the company reported a 60% plunge in its 4QFY21 net profit on lower sales and normalisation of ASP across its glove products. For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2021 (FY21), Kossan’s net profit jumped 162.6% to RM2.85 billion, from RM1.09 billion in the previous year. Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Sophie Chua Siu Li in a note Friday said that despite Kossan results coming in line, she lowered her forecasts for FY22 to FY23 by 43% to 67%, to account for the lower ASP as well higher operating costs. “Going forward, we expect industry-wide headwinds to continue to linger, with ASPs and margins remaining under pressure,” she said while maintaining a \"hold\" call on the stock. Consequently, her target price (TP) for Kossan was lowered to RM1.53 (from RM2.65), implying a valuation of 12 times the price-earnings ratio (PER) on its FY22 earnings per share (EPS) of 12.7 sen. Affin Hwang Investment Bank analyst Ng Chi Hoong said 2022 would be a challenging year for Kossan, as he is expecting ASPs to continue to decline before the company is able to deliver more products to its client. “Due to the shipping constraints and declining ASPs, we cut our EPS forecasts for FY22 to FY23 by 28% to 50%. “As a result, we also lower our TP to RM1.20 from RM2.40 (based on an unchanged nine times of 2022 estimated price-earnings ratio [PER]), and downgrade our call to 'sell' from 'hold', as investor sentiment on the sector is likely to remain weak due to uncertainty on ASPs,” he said. Meanwhile, BIMB Securities analyst Saffa Amanina said she revised down Kossan's FY22 and FY23 earnings by 45% and 23% respectively, to factor in lower FY22 and FY23 blended ASP assumptions to US$25 (RM104.62) and US$24 (from US$29 and US$26) per 1,000 pieces, lower sales volume, lower margin and one-off prosperity tax. In tandem with earnings revision, she derived a lower TP of RM1.80 (from RM2.40) for Kossan based on unchanged PER of 15 times pegged on 2023 EPS of 12 sen. She also maintained a \"hold\" call on the stock. While Kossan's latest profit was deemed in line with her expectation, she concurred with other analysts that tough operating conditions are likely to persist in 2022. “We expect Kossan’s 1HFY22 earnings to be impacted by lower ASP as well as volume due to supply chain disruptions caused by shipment issues and labour shortage. “Profit margin could further erode due to overall higher operating cost as well as one-off prosperity tax,” she said. In a separate note, Kenanga Research analyst Raymond Choo Ping Khoon said he downgraded his FY22 net profit forecast for Kossan by 10% as he changed his ASP assumption from US$27 to US$25 per 1,000 pieces and nudged down earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margin from 20% to 19%. While reiterating \"market perform\" on the stock, he lowered its TP from RM1.80 to RM1.65 based on 13 times of FY22 EPS of 12.5 sen. “The group highlighted that the performance in the quarter was also affected by logistic challenges caused by the global shipping container shortage which we understand are unlikely to abate over the next two quarters. “In the meantime, margins in subsequent quarters could be impacted as raw material cost is not adjusting as fast as falling ASP and hence earnings are expected to be lower sequentially in 1QFY22,” he said. TA Securities analyst Tan Kong Jin said he reduced Kossan FY22 and FY23 earnings projections by 27% and 21.8% after reducing its sales volumes by 8.7% and net margin by 2.5 percentage points. “Looking forward, we expect 1QFY22 ASP to decline by circa-33% quarter-on-quarter but volumes to improve due restocking and inventory adjustments by customers, “The group’s current capacity stood at 33.5 billion gloves per annum. We believe the group will slow down its expansion plans whereby we expect Phase 1 of P21 (two billion gloves) to start production in 2HFY22 (previously 1HFY22),” he said. While reiterating a \"buy\" call on Kossan, he lowered its TP to RM1.96 from RM2.50 following the earnings revision. The TP was based on an unchanged PE of 17 times of its 2023 EPS. RHB Investment Bank analyst Sean Chew also cut Kossan earnings forecast by 5% for FY23, after revising its sales volume assumption on latest changes in its expansion plan. “Looking into the quarters ahead, we believe earnings will continue to normalise as ASP finds an equilibrium,” he said. However, after the recent share price retracement, he sees value emerging for Kossan given its inexpensive valuations at 13 times of FY23 PE (below its 10-year average of 16 times). Thus, he maintained a \"buy\" call on Kossan, with an unchanged TP of RM2.05. As for MIDF Research, Kossan FY21 results were below its expectations, and the negative variation was attributable to declining ASPs. “The group expects the supply and demand imbalance to persist in the near term and the continued tapering of glove demand and ASP. “In spite of the 4QFY21 underperformance, we maintain our forward earnings estimates as we believe we have already imputed sufficiently low ASP and demand assumptions in our forecast for FY22 onwards,” it said. It maintained a \"neutral\" call on Kossan and revised down its TP to RM1.78 from RM2.17. The TP is derived from a revised valuation of 10.25 times PER pegged to FY22 EPS of 17.3 sen. At 10.35am Friday, Kossan rose five sen or 2.96% to RM1.74, valuing the group at RM4.37 billion. The counter has declined 63.06% from its one-year peak of RM4.71 on April 26, 2020.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 18): Analysts say the RM2 billion valuation that Main Market-bound Farm Fresh Bhd is said to be looking at from its initial public offering (IPO) appears justified. The Khazanah Nasional Bhd-backed dairy producer, which is expected to be listed within the first quarter of the year, has yet to announce its IPO pricing. When contacted, Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong said a back-of-the-envelope calculation showed that Farm Fresh should be valued at about 60 times price-earnings (P/E) multiples based on the company’s profit after tax (PAT) of RM32.83 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 (FY21). Stripped off its one-off tax liability and penalty of RM25.71 million, Leong said Farm Fresh’s normalised PAT of RM58.54 million should value the company close to 30 times P/E multiple. Compared to its peers, Farm Fresh’s valuation is sitting somewhere between Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd and Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N), he said. The trailing 12-month price-earnings (TTM P/E) ratio was 53.6 times for Nestle, 25.1 times for F&N and 24.4 times for Dutch Lady, according to Bloomberg. Another analyst, who requested anonymity, expects Farm Fresh to be valued at mid-20 times P/E, on par with F&N and Dutch Lady’s valuation. Both analysts believe that Farm Fresh’s P/E valuation is justified, taking into account the company’s growth prospect and its leading market share in the ready-to-drink milk category. Leong said the company can ride on the population growth and enjoy the benefits of economic reopening, which is a catalyst to spur demand for its products. Meanwhile, another analyst believes Farm Fresh can continue to chart strong earnings growth going forward, which will be driven by its increasing herd size for dairy cattle. “One of the key drivers, which is their dairy cattle, has been increasing. As long as the company continues to allocate capex for farming, it should be able to continue to grow,” he said. He also observed that Farm Fresh’s products have gained popularity, given its shelf place in the retail stores has been expanding over the years. “Another [comparative] advantage for Farm Fresh is being an integrated dairy farming player, covering from (upstream) farming activity until (downstream) manufacturing, whereas its peer does not have in-house dairy farming and buying from others,” he added. Farm Fresh is Malaysia's second-largest player in the ready-to-drink milk category with a market share of 18%, and the third-largest in the yoghurt category with a market share of 11% for the first half of 2021, according to the company’s IPO draft prospectus posted on Securities Commission Malaysia website. The company operates five dairy farms in Malaysia and one in Australia, with a total herd size of 9,000 dairy cows and bulls. It also owns and operates two processing facilities in Malaysia, with the capacity to produce around 137 litres of finished goods annually and one processing facility in Australia, with the capacity to produce 84 million litres of processed milk annually. From FY19 to FY21, the company's PAT attributable to owners grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9% from RM27.4 million to RM36.2 million, while its revenue increased by a CAGR of 65.9% from RM178.2 million to RM490.5 million. Passing down additional costs to end-users Amidst the industry-wide practice of increasing commodity prices, analysts expect Farm Fresh to be able to pass down the additional costs to end-users and protect its margin, given customers’ \"stickiness\" towards its products. MIDF Research, in an emailed response, said as with any other consumer staple companies, inflation is an issue at the moment. “There could be potential headwinds for the sector as whole, with the rise in raw material prices due to inflation. In order to maintain margins moving forward, companies in the sector might have to resort to passing on the higher raw material prices to consumers and hike prices. \"However, with its innovative distribution business model such as the home dealers system, we opine that there is a possibility that the company will be adaptable to navigate future business challenges,” said the research firm. “While fresh milk is a staple in Malaysian households, an increase in the price of milk could result in the price-sensitive consumers resorting to more affordable brands, considering the concurrent increase in the price of other household items. However, we note that the wide-range of milk options that the company offers, which includes plant-based milk, will remain a strong factor to maintain customer stickiness, despite potential price hikes,” it added. Meanwhile, another analyst said Farm Fresh is also able to pass down the additional cost via innovation by adjusting the products pricing in the form of providing value added features to convince the customers to buy. Bloomberg, citing sources, reported last week that Farm Fresh had attracted almost 30 cornerstone investors, including Aberdeen Standard Investments and AIA Group Ltd, in a planned IPO. Great Eastern Life Assurance, Franklin Templeton Investment and some Malaysian state funds had also signed on, and the first-time share sale is expected to raise about RM1 billion, the report said. Farm Fresh’s IPO is set to be the country’s biggest since last June, when CTOS Digital Bhd, which runs a credit reporting agency, and its shareholders raised RM1.21 billion. On Tuesday (Feb 15), Farm Fresh signed an underwriting agreement with CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB IB), Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd, AmInvestment Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd for its IPO.

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 17): Analysts remain bullish on MR DIY Group (M) Bhd as the Covid-19 pandemic which has dampened consumer spending has not disrupted its earnings growth. UOBKayHian analyst Philip Wong said in a note on Thursday (Feb 17) that he maintains a \"buy\" rating on MR DIY with an unchanged target price of RM4.85. His target price is based on a price-earnings (PE) ratio pegged to 45 times of its earnings per share (EPS) of 10.8 sen for the financial year ended Dec 31, 2022 (FY22). The PE peg is at a 15% discount to large-cap domestic consumer peers, Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd and QL Resources Bhd, which historically traded at 54 times, according to him. “Despite being a retailer, MR DIY has displayed extremely resilient earnings and offers superior three-year profit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.2% versus its fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) peers (10.3%),” he said. In 2022, he said MR DIY is targeting for 180 stores, which should consist of 150 MR DIY outlets, 15 MR Dollar stores and 15 MR TOY stores. “The store rollout will be in favour of MR DIY and MR DIY Express store formats, given their better economics which are skewed towards standalone stores,” he said. He also noted that MR DIY earnings for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 (4QFY21) were within expectations, despite disruptive heavy seasonal weather. “Instead, easing restrictions led to impressive sales growth. Higher economies of scale cushioned slippage in gross margins with relative ease. “With 2022 representing further recovery off a low base, combined with the anticipated record store openings, MR DIY is poised for attractive growth,” he added. MR DIY told a bourse filing on Wednesday that its net profit for 4QFY21 grew by 24.28% to a record high of RM134.55 million from RM108.26 million in the same period of the previous year, on the back of a RM10.7 million gain in operating income during the quarter. For FY21, its net profit increased by 28.08% to RM431.83 million, against RM337.16 million in FY20. The company also declared a single-tier dividend of 0.9 sen per share, taking its total dividend declared for the financial year to 2.95 sen. AmInvestment Bank analyst Muhammad Afif Zukaplly said in a note that he reiterated his \"buy\" call on MR DIY with a higher fair value (FV) of RM4.45, from RM4.15, based on a 2% upward revision of FY22-23 earnings. The FV was based on PE pegged to 39.9 times to its FY22 EPS of 9.5 sen. “Our revised FV also reflects the company’s near-to-medium term plan of continuing to focus on expanding MR DIY’s network, given its ability to deliver superior return,” said Muhammad Afif. He continued to like MR DIY for its strong operating cash flow from its existing stores, proactive leadership of the management, and prospect of the new MR DIY Express store format. The stronger 4QFY21 earnings, according to him, were mainly due to a growth in transactions and sales from the same stores, as well as basket size, thanks to the reopening of the economy in mid-August last year. He also did not rule out the possibility of the company raising the prices of its products amid rising operational costs, but believes MR DIY may still be able to price its products relatively cheaper than its competitors, given its extensive store network and direct access to suppliers, which could cushion the impact on its transaction volume. Meanwhile, RHB Research analyst Soong Wei Siang also said in a note that he maintains his “buy” call on MR DIY with an unchanged TP of RM4.59, which is based on FY22 PE of 39.58 times to EPS of 10 sen. He continued to like MR DIY as a proxy to resilient domestic consumption — its three-year earnings compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% will be anchored by the effective business model and entrenched brand equity. “This should propel further valuation rerating, considering the scarcity of large-cap consumer stocks offering robust earnings growth,” he said. Apart from the network expansion, he said that cost and operational efficiencies, as well as supply chain management will be the other areas of focus for management to drive growth, going forward. “With the ongoing price lock campaign only ending in March, we believe MR DIY will maintain its selling prices, notwithstanding the higher input costs. This should render MR DIY market share gains and thereafter, the company will evaluate the situation before deciding on its pricing strategy. As such, the gross profit margin pressure is likely to persist into 1QFY22,” he said. Hong Leong Investment Bank Research analyst Syifaa Mahsuri Ismail also maintained a \"buy\" call on MR DIY with an unchanged TP of RM4.51. The TP is based on PE multiple of 50 times pegged to FY22 EPS of 9 sen. “[T]he group strategy of clawing market share with price lock campaign has garnered positive feedback from the consumers,” she said in a note on Thursday, while maintaining its earnings forecasts. Kenanga Investment Bank Research analyst Ahmad Ramzani Ramli, however, in a note on Thursday downgraded MR DIY call to market perform from outperform, as he opined that the stock is being fully-valued with uninspiring dividend yield. Its TP is reduced to RM4, based on a FY22 price to earnings ratio (PER) of 37 times and EPS of 10.8 sen. According to him, MR DIY FY21 results were in line despite margins suffering slight erosion, lower targeted stores and transaction/store/day. “We expect FY22 to continue to be robust given the reopening of the economy (and) further expansion of stores, though margins are likely to be under pressure due to volatile input costs. “We, however, revised down our FY22 earnings by 4% on lower average transaction/store/day estimate,” he said. Affin Hwang Investment analyst Damia Othman, on the other hand, maintained a “hold” call on MR DIY in his note on Thursday. He, however, revised up MR DIY TP to RM3.85 from RM3.39 pegged to a 45 times FY22 PE and EPS of 8.5 sen. He also increased MR DIY’s earnings forecasts by 0.8%-3.6% for FY22 to FY23, after inputting the FY21 results into his model. “With 60% of its stores located in malls, this may pose a threat to earnings over the near term as consumers are cautious over the rising number of Covid-19 cases,” he said. At market close on Thursday, MR DIY slipped five sen or 1.32% to RM3.74, valuing the group at RM23.49 billion.

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 17): Credit-reporting agency CTOS Digital Bhd plans to raise RM270 million via a private placement of up to 166.67 million new shares at an indicative RM1.62 each to fund proposed acquisitions and investments to further grow its business. In a Bursa Malaysia filing on Thursday (Feb 17), CTOS said the placement shares are intended to be placed out to third party investors and the corporate exercise is expected to be implemented in a single tranche within six months from the date of approval from the bourse regulator for the listing and quotation of the placement shares on the Main Market of Bursa. \"The proposed placement is not expected to have any material effect on the earnings of the CTOS Digital group for the financial year ending Dec 31, 2022, save for the dilution in EPS (earnings per share) as a result of the increase in the number of CTOS Digital shares in issue pursuant to the proposed placement. \"As at the LPD (latest practicable date of Jan 31, 2022), there are 2.2 billion (2,200,000,000) CTOS Digital shares in issue. \"Barring any unforeseen circumstances, the proposed placement is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2022,” CTOS said. According to CTOS, the placement of the new shares will enlarge its number of issued shares to 2.37 billion. CTOS, which has proposed to acquire a 49% stake in enterprise software specialist Juris Technologies Sdn Bhd for RM205.8 million, is also buying an additional 2.25% equity interest in Business Online Public Co Ltd (BOL), which provides business support services. According to CTOS, out of the RM270 million placement share proceeds, RM205.8 million will be used to finance the acquisition of the 49% stake in Juris while RM34.9 million has been allocated for the purchase of the additional 2.25% equity interest in BOL. Meanwhile, RM25.6 million has been set aside for \"acquisitions to be identified”. \"One of the company’s ongoing plans is to selectively pursue acquisitions and investments in companies as part of its growth strategy. CTOS Digital typically seeks assets that have direct cost and capability synergies with its digital solutions, enabling it to expand its digital solutions offering, achieve value chain integration for its existing segments and customers, and facilitate entry into new verticals. \"In the event the company is unable to fully utilise the proceeds allocated for acquisitions to be identified, such unutilised amount will be used for the working capital requirement of the group,” CTOS said. Maybank Investment Bank Bhd has been appointed as principal adviser to CTOS and joint placement agent for the proposed new share placement, according to CTOS. The other joint placement agents for the proposed share placement are CIMB Investment Bank Bhd, Credit Suisse Securities (M) Sdn Bhd, Credit Suisse (Singapore) Ltd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd, CTOS said. At 5pm on Thursday, CTOS’ share price closed two sen or 1.14% lower at RM1.73, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM3.81 billion. The stock saw 1.39 million shares traded.\n",
      "/article/dual-wholesale-network-model-5g-implementation-will-create-confusion-says-expert\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 16): Using a dual wholesale network (DWN) model to implement 5G will create confusion in the market, according to adviser to the United Nation (UN) on 5G strategy and policy Brett Haan. Speaking at a media briefing on Wednesday (Feb 16), Haan said the DWN model will raise a lot of questions that will pose further challenges in implementing the 5G technology. “The DWN model, to me personally raises questions such as — are these entities friends or competitors? “Are they going to go to the same capital markets for financing? Are they going to the same vendors? “How are you going to handle cybersecurity which is critical? How are you going to coordinate those two firms? That to me just creates confusion,” he said. Haan also stressed that Malaysia will not suffer the same fate as Mexico in implementing the 5G technology as Malaysia is learning lessons from other countries. “The government could have chosen a regional network perspective but they (Malaysian government) chose a national one which is totally legitimate and totally understandable. “[In implementing 5G] you know you want to have good business operations, have a good vendor and you want to have some sort of transparent reporting,” he shared. The federal government has yet to decide on the single wholesale network (SWN) model for 5G rollout in the county and recently, Digital Nasional Bhd (DNB)’s chief executive officer Ralph Marshall, in his reply to Bangi member of Parliament (MP) Ong Kian Ming, stressed that there will be enormous implications should the government decide on having a DWN model. “It is highly unlikely that DNB in its current form will survive should there be another wholesale network provider. “With the failure of DNB, the second wholesale provider will then eventually become a private SWN monopoly. “There are also financial, legal and reputational implications for the country and the government should DNB be discontinued,” Marshall said. Meanwhile, RHB Investment Bank in its research note on Jan 25 said the DWN model would cause more challenges, delay 5G execution, and contribute to excess capacity in the long run. Its analyst Jeffrey Tan said in a note that DWN would also negate DNB’s strategic supply-driven model/mandate, resulting in potentially higher cost to serve as traffic and revenue will be shared.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 16): RHB Investment Bank Bhd has maintained a ‘buy’ call on Duopharma Biotech Bhd with an unchanged target price (TP) of RM1.91 per share after registering sturdy numbers for financial year 2021 (FY21). The research house said Duopharma reported a core net profit of RM67 million, at 97% of its full-year estimates with topline growing 12% year-on-year (y-o-y), sustained by the continued robust demand for consumer healthcare products and recovery in the public health sector. In a research note on Wednesday (Feb 16), RHB said despite the depreciation of the ringgit against the US dollar, the company continued to record resilient gross margins for the fourth quarter 2022 (4Q22). “We believe its long-term earnings growth prospects remain bright, on the back of its efforts to improve product offerings while venturing into high-value therapies,” it shared. Meanwhile, CGS-CIMB reiterated a ‘hold’ call on Duopharma with an unchanged TP of RM1.60. The research house said Duopharma’s FY21 results were in line with its expectation but 4Q21 core earnings per share (EPS) fell 10% y-o-y due to lower margins. CGS-CIMB said y-o-y local sales grew a healthy 8.1% y-o-y, thanks to continued good take-up of its consumer healthcare (CHC) products, such as immunity-boosting products which is 20% to 25% of total sales and recovery in public sector sales. Nonetheless, it said local revenue eased 14% quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q), mainly due to seasonally weaker public sector demand while 4Q21 export revenue, which is 5% of total, remained tepid at RM8 million due to Covid-19-led logistical challenges. However, CGS-CIMB said it forecasts a better FY22 performance for Duopharma and raised FY22 core EPS by 11% to factor in potential one-off RM10 million tax savings of reinvestment allowance upon the commissioning of its K3 plant targeted for FY22. “We now see core EPS growing a strong 19% in FY22 from private/public sector sales growth and tax savings, before moderating to 4% in FY23 due to some softening in CHC sales growth post-Covid-19 and lack of tax savings, and then resuming to 10% in FY24,” it added.

      "/article/bumi-armada-shares-rally-oil-prices-hit-sevenyear-high\n",
      "THE share price of oil and gas player Bumi Armada Bhd hit a 52-week high of 55 sen last Monday, as oil crossed the US$90 per barrel mark for the first time in seven years. The stock has appreciated 17% year to date, in tandem with the 18% increase in Brent crude oil, which hit US$91 per barrel last Monday — the highest level since October 2014. Higher oil prices positively impact Bumi Armada as they act as a catalyst for investments, which in turn provide opportunities in terms of new projects for the company’s core business, floating production storage and offloading vessels, or FPSOs. It has a fleet of seven FPSOs (four wholly owned and three jointly owned), a liquefied natural gas floating storage unit and a partially owned FPSO under construction. Bumi Armada’s offshore marine services (OMS) segment also gets a boost from the higher oil prices as it means new exploration activity, which creates demand for its assets. But the OMS fleet comprises ageing ships, which are not competitive. However, Bumi Armada is exiting the OMS segment to focus on the more lucrative FPSO business. Towards this end, it has announced the disposal of four ice class vessels (ships that operate in icy weather) to Russian oil and gas giant PJSC Lukoil for US$44.5 million (RM186.6 million). Bumi Armada is slated to utilise US$38 million of the proceeds to pare down its borrowings and US$6.5 million for working capital purposes. Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB) Research says of the disposal, “We are positive on this development as it would be earnings accretive to Bumi Armada in its financial year ending Dec 31, 2022 (FY2022) and beyond, and the bulk of the proceeds will be used to further strengthen its balance sheet … Based on our calculations, this would reduce the group’s net debt from RM6.5 billion to RM6.3 billion, and net gearing ratio from 1.71 times to 1.66 times.” HLIB Research has a “buy” call on Bumi Armada, with a target price of 84 sen, an upside of 53% to its last traded price of 55 sen last Thursday. “We think Bumi Armada is highly compelling, given its foothold in the floating production and operation business, which provides steady recurring income, coupled with speedy enhancement to its debt profile. We are convinced that [the group] should see clearer skies ahead with its ongoing efforts to continue improving its balance sheet and cash flow management,” says the research house. HLIB is one of 12 brokerages with a “buy” call on the stock. RHB Investment Bank is another, with a target price of 62 sen. “We expect its FY2022 to FY2023 recurring earnings to improve by 6% to 8% with the absence of losses from these [ice class ship] companies, and we expect its balance sheet to improve on the back of healthy operating cash flow, led by stable FPSO operations and continuous asset monetisation,” it says in a note published last month. Bumi Armada reported a net profit of RM456.06 million on revenue of RM1.72 billion for the nine months ended Sept 30, 2021 (9MFY2021), compared with a net loss of RM18.58 million on revenue of RM1.72 billion in the previous corresponding period. The higher profitability was the result of lower finance costs, higher share of results from joint ventures and higher operating income during the year, as well as the absence of impairment losses on vessels that were recognised in 2020. In a note following the release of the group’s financial results in November last year, Maybank Investment Bank says Bumi Armada’s turnaround story is beginning to gain traction. “Improving cash flows and monetising non-core assets are its key performance indicators. It will continue to de-gear and seek redeployment opportunities for its fleet,” says the investment bank. In 2019, Bumi Armada’s 30:70 joint venture with India-based Shapoorji Pallonji Group — Shapoorji Pallonji Bumi Armada Godavari Pte Ltd — was awarded a nine-year FPSO charter contract worth US$2.1 billion by India’s state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd. However, the construction of the FPSO in the east coast city of Kakinada, termed the 98/2 project, has been delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. CGS-CIMB Research, which has a “hold” call on Bumi Armada, says: “We have included the contribution of FPSO 98/2 into our target price and earnings forecast for 3Q2022, [however] these may need to be deferred … Given the uncertainties, we apply a new 10% discount to the sum of parts of 57 sen to derive our target price of 51 sen.” UOB Kay Hian, in a note published last month, also maintains its “hold” call on the stock, with a target price of 49 sen. “Despite the higher oil prices, we do not see any near-term catalysts for now until the subsea segment, which was the fundamental drag for many years, manages to secure material contracts,” it says in the note. Bumi Armada counts tycoon T Ananda Krishnan as its largest shareholder, with a 34.8% stake. Its share price had appreciated 59% over the past year to close at 55 sen last Thursday, giving the company a market capitalisation of RM3.25 billion.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 15): Dairy producer Farm Fresh Bhd has signed an underwriting agreement in conjunction with its initial public offering (IPO) on the Main Market of Bursa Malaysia Securities. In a statement on Tuesday (Feb 15), Farm Fresh said it signed the agreement with CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB IB), Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd, AmInvestment Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd. The IPO — of up to 743.2 million ordinary shares in Farm Fresh — comprises an offer for sale of up to 520.2 million existing shares (offer shares) and a public issue of 223 million new shares. The 743.2 million IPO shares comprise an institutional offering of up to 687.4 million IPO shares and a retail offering of 55.7 million issue shares. Farm Fresh is expected to be listed in the first quarter of 2022. Farm Fresh group managing director and group chief executive officer (CEO) Loi Tuan Ee said the underwriting agreement takes the group one step closer to its planned debut on the Main Market of Bursa. “In the span of 12 years, we have grown into a strong dairy producer despite stiff competition,” he said. Meanwhile, CIMB IB CEO Jefferi Hashim said: \"CIMB is proud to play an instrumental role in the IPO of Farm Fresh, a company that has grown rapidly in the Malaysian dairy space. “Farm Fresh’s combination of innovative products and business model has proven its resilience in a challenging economic environment and is poised for further growth as the economy recovers,\" said Jefferi. Last Friday, Bloomberg, citing sources, reported that Farm Fresh had attracted almost 30 cornerstone investors, including Aberdeen Standard Investments and AIA Group Ltd, in a planned IPO. Great Eastern Life Assurance, Franklin Templeton Investment and some Malaysian state funds had also signed on, and the first-time share sale is expected to raise about RM1 billion, according to Bloomberg. Bloomberg also reported that Farm Fresh’s IPO is set to be the country’s biggest since last June, when CTOS Digital Bhd, which runs a credit reporting agency, and its shareholders raised RM1.21 billion. CIMB IB is the sole principal adviser and a joint global coordinator, joint bookrunner, joint managing underwriter and joint underwriter of Farm Fresh’s IPO. Maybank IB is a joint global coordinator, joint bookrunner, joint managing underwriter and joint underwriter. Affin Hwang IB, AmInvestment, Hong Leong IB and RHB IB are joint underwriters of the IPO.

      "ALLIANCE Bank Malaysia Bhd could be the next lender to see a leadership change as its CEO Joel Kornreich’s contract is set to expire at the end of this year, sources say. The Edge understands that the lender, the smallest of eight local banking groups by asset size, has already begun the process of looking for his replacement. “There is a search going on for candidates,” one source tells The Edge. Kornreich, a Belgian, has been with the bank for over seven years now, since being appointed to the group CEO role on Jan 1, 2015. Prior to joining the Alliance banking group, he was with Citigroup for 20 years in various roles across the world. The 56-year-old is also an executive director of Alliance Bank’s Islamic banking subsidiary, Alliance Islamic Bank Bhd. When contacted, Kornreich declined to comment on his CEO position, but confirmed that his current contract runs until the end of this year. “I definitely want to see through the end of my contract. After that, it’s the board’s decision,” he tells The Edge. Alliance Bank is backed by Singapore state investor Temasek Holdings Ltd. Temasek’s interest in the bank is held through Duxton Investments Pte Ltd, which holds 49% of Vertical Theme Sdn Bhd, which in turn holds a direct 29.06% stake in the bank. The remaining 51% stake in Vertical Theme is held by Langkah Bahagia Sdn Bhd, which is owned by Singapore hotelier Ong Beng Seng, Ong Tiong Sing and corporate adviser Seow Lun Hoo. The other substantial shareholder of Alliance Bank is the Employees Provident Fund, which held a 13.7% stake as at Jan 19. Under Kornreich, Alliance Bank has deepened its niche in SME (small and medium enterprise) banking amid stiff competition from bigger banks such as AMMB Holdings Bhd that are also aggressively growing in that segment. The former is aiming to be among the top four banks in Malaysia in terms of SME loans. “Right now, our market share of loan balances is just getting past the 5% mark. Three years ago, we were less than 3.5%. For us to be top four, it would require us to get to around 9%. The way we intend to do that is, we’re beefing up the teams, we’ve launched digital SME and, of course, we’ve digitised much of the SME business. We see that we have momentum, so we think we can make that happen,” Kornreich told The Edge in an interview last December. On Dec 2, the bank announced that it would sell its stockbroking business to Philip Futures Sdn Bhd. Upon completion of the deal in the first half of this year, Alliance Bank will be the only local banking group without stockbroking operations. Given its small size, the bank is often seen as a takeover target. Nevertheless, analysts say there is no urgent need for it to be merged with another. Over the last five years, the group’s net profit peaked at RM538 million in the financial year ended March 31, 2019 (FY2019), before coming down to RM424 million in FY2020 and RM359 million in FY2021. Industry to see many leadership changes The speculated change at Alliance Bank comes amid a slew of other upcoming leadership changes in the banking industry. Late last month, the country’s largest lender, Malayan Banking Bhd (Maybank), announced that Datuk Khairussaleh Ramli will be made its new president and CEO from May 1. Khairussaleh, who is RHB Bank Bhd’s group managing director/CEO, had already tendered his resignation from the fourth-largest lender — effective March 25 — and is currently on a leave of absence. He will be taking over from Maybank’s current chief, Datuk Seri Abdul Farid Alias, who is leaving the group on April 30. Abdul Farid, who has held the post for over eight years, since August 2013, had earlier this year indicated to the board that he would not be seeking a renewal of his contract, which expires Aug 1, as he wished to pursue his own interests. Meanwhile, RHB has initiated its transition plan and the selection process for a new CEO is currently ongoing. Over at AMMB, chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim wants to retire from the sixth-largest lender on March 31, which is the end of its financial year. He will be given a new role as chairman emeritus/honorary adviser and remains a major shareholder of the group. AMMB said it would announce the appointment of a new chairman in due course. Apart from these three banks, foreign lender HSBC Bank Malaysia Bhd on Jan 12 appointed Omar Siddiq as its new CEO to succeed Stuart Milne, who is retiring. Omar was CIMB Group Holdings Bhd’s CEO of group wholesale banking and the deputy CEO of CIMB Bank Malaysia. There could also be changes at development financial institution Bank Pembangunan Malaysia Bhd. The Edge reported in its Jan 17 issue that there was speculation that CEO Arshad Mohamed Ismail could be coming to the end of a three-year term and may be looking to leave. “It is not often the industry sees so many leadership changes in one year,” a banking analyst remarks. The new leaders will be coming into their roles at a time the industry is seen recovering after two years of taking a hit from the Covid-19 pandemic. Analysts expect banks to do better this year on the back of a recovering economy, a potential hike in interest rates and lower provisions. However, there remain many challenges as coronavirus variants still pose a risk.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 14): Bursa Malaysia’s Energy index rose about 2% on Monday (Feb 14) to become the top percentage gainer among bourse gauges after global crude oil prices surged past US$96 a barrel to their highest in more than seven years as investors weighed a potential crude oil supply disruption due to a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia. At Bursa’s 12.30pm break, Bursa’s Energy index, which tracks share prices of oil and gas (O&G)-related companies, settled up 13.55 points or 1.72% at 802.34. It was reported that oil prices on Monday hit their highest in more than seven years on fears that a possible invasion of Ukraine by Russia could trigger US and European sanctions that would disrupt exports from the world's top producer in an already tight market. Brent crude futures was at US$95.56 a barrel by 0235 GMT, up US$1.12, or 1.2%, after earlier hitting a peak of $US96.16, the highest since October 2014. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose US$1.28, or 1.4%, to US$94.38 a barrel, hovering near a session-high of US$94.94, the loftiest since September 2014. \"Comments from the US about an imminent attack by Russia on Ukraine have rattled global financial markets. \"Russia could invade Ukraine at any time and might create a surprise pretext for an attack, the US said on Sunday (Feb 13),” Reuters reported. In Malaysia on Monday, RHB Investment Bank Bhd analyst Sean Lim wrote in a note that RHB, which maintained its “overweight” call on Malaysia and Thailand's O&G sector, has raised RHB’s Brent crude oil price forecasts to US$90 and US$75 a barrel for 2022 and 2023 respectively, from US$83 and US$70 previously to reflect the heightened geopolitical tension between Russia and Ukraine, and the continuous shortfall in meeting the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (Opec) production quota. \"Near-term oil prices could be fuelled by the continuous heightened geopolitical tensions. Oil prices could potentially hit US$110-US$120 /bbl if Russia decides to invade Ukraine, and these could stay elevated for longer, depending on the magnitude of the event. “(RHB is) overweight on Malaysia and Thailand’s O&G sectors. Exploration & production and petrochemical companies should continue to enjoy strong earnings, while riding on stronger commodity prices.

Lim said RHB’s top picks for the Malaysian O&G sector are Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd and Bumi Armada Bhd. Meanwhile, TA Securities Holdings Bhd analysts wrote in a note on Monday that key beneficiaries of the Russia-Ukraine tension-driven market volatility will be shares of plantation and O&G companies as commodity prices surge. \"Sector wise, the banking, plantation, O&G, consumer and technology-related stocks should continue to attract bargain hunters with the sustained firm CPO (crude palm oil) and crude oil prices supporting bullish sentiment, and also due to economic recovery plays,” TA Securities said.

      "/article/press-metal-shares-hit-alltime-high-amid-robust-aluminium-prices\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 10): Aluminium smelter Press Metal Aluminium Holdings Bhd’s share price hit its all-time high to RM6.68 after rising by as much as 19 sen or 2.93% from its opening price of RM6.45 on Thursday (Feb 10). This comes as Bloomberg reported on Tuesday (Feb 8) that aluminium prices neared a 13-year high of US$3,215 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange (LME), while Goldman Sachs Group Inc has predicted that the commodity will fetch an even higher price as supply disruptions from China to Europe further tighten the market. Based on Bloomberg data, the average target price for Press Metal stood at RM7.64 while the consensus rating was “buy” based on eight analysts’ recommendations. Of all the analysts, Nomura's and RHB Research’s were the most bullish with a target price of RM8.30 and RM8.50 respectively. Speaking to RHB Research’s analyst Sean Chew, he said that the surge in aluminium prices will remain above trend based on the supply and demand for the commodity. “On the supply side, production is affected in various regions of Europe and China due to rising energy costs and environmental/de-carbonization policies. “We believe the road to re-starting of such plants won’t be short as Chinese producers (the largest globally) will continue to be constrained by its dual energy control policy and we do not observe any significant planned capacity expansion ex-China. “On the demand front, consumption is only expected to rise from the rising adoption of renewable energy (solar), electric vehicles and recyclable packaging,” Chew said. The sentiment was also shared by UOB Kay Hian’s analyst Desmond Chong who said in a research note on Thursday that the recent price movement of aluminium was way above the research house’s conservative assumption of US$2,400/tonne in 2022. Chong added that aluminium smelters globally, including Press Metal, have low inventory levels and have insufficient products to supply their key markets. UOB Kay Hian added that they are expecting a record quarterly net profit in the region of RM346 million to RM403 million or 22%-42% quarter-on-quarter and 100%-133% year-on-year growth from Press Metal. This comes after the four consecutive record-breaking quarters that it had achieved since its fourth quarter ended Dec 30, 2020 (4QFY20) according to Chong. Hong Leong Investment Bank (HLIB Research) was also among the many that shared a “buy” call on Press Metal with a target price of RM7.25 in a research update on Feb 4. HLIB Research’s analyst Jeremie Yap said that the recent price development is positive for Press Metal as it translates into strong earnings. “If you overlay the aluminium prices with Press Metal’s share price, you can see that they are somewhat positively correlated so it is not surprising that Press Metal has managed to renew its all-time high recently,” Yap told theedgemarkets.com. HLIB Research estimates that Press Metal’s fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 (4QFY21) core earnings will reach a record high between RM330 million and RM370 million which are equivalent to 16%-31% Q-o-Q and 100-125% Y-o-Y growth, barring any unforeseen swings in cost structure. Press Metal’s ESG advantage through Samalaju According to Chong, the largest integrated aluminium producer in Southeast Asia also has another card up its sleeve, as it had fully commenced operations of its Samalaju P3 plant in Sarawak in the fourth quarter of 2021, which expanded the group’s total smelting capacity by 320,000 tonnes or 42% from 760,000 tonnes. Notably, Press Metal has a hydro power purchase agreement (PPA) with Syarikat SESCO (Sarawak Energy) for the purchase of electric power of up to 500MW (megawatts) for its P3 aluminium smelter plant at Samalaju Industrial Park, Sarawak which helps the group to formulate a clear roadmap for ESG sustainability, according to Chong. Similarly, Yap from HLIB Research also cited that Press Metal’s low carbon footprint where its smelting plants are predominantly powered by hydroelectric sources and ESG profile will make it more favourable to investors. Yap highlighted that Press Metal has plans to become carbon neutral in 2050 by cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 15% and 30% by 2025 and 2030 respectively, while also aiming to reduce water withdrawal by 10% by 2030. Meanwhile, Chew from RHB Research suggests that downside risks to Press Metal should “mainly come in the form of softening in aluminium prices and higher-than-expected raw material costs”. But the analyst also pointed out that the downside risk to Press Metal is related to geopolitical trends such as China relaxing its decarbonisation mandate which could drive Chinese smelters to rapidly restart their operations and improve the supply outlook. “We believe that the risk of China backpedalling is low and if they choose to do so, the aluminium sector should be one of the last to restart given its high energy intensity. “Secondly, political turmoil in Guinea could lead to lower production of bauxite as it has occurred previously and this affects the availability of alumina (key raw material for aluminium smelting) which subsequently increases the cost of aluminium smelting,” Chew added on the risks to Press Metal’s outlook. At market close on Thursday, Press Metal shares were 19 sen or 2.93% higher at RM6.68, valuing the group at RM53.97 billion based on 8.08 billion outstanding shares while trading at 66.8 times earnings. Since Wednesday, Press Metal shares have appreciated by 56.34% or RM2.40 in absolute ringgit value. Last April, the group had undertaken a bonus issue of 4.04 billion shares on the basis of one free share for every existing share held.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 9): Analysts are taking a positive stance on YTL Power International Bhd (YTLP) after it had disposed of its 33.5% equity interest in Australia’s ElectraNet Pty Ltd for A$1.03 billion (RM3.06 billion). RHB Research and Maybank Investment Bank (Maybank IB) had upgraded their ‘neutral’ call on YTLP to ‘buy’, with an unchanged target price (TP) of 68 sen and 70 sen respectively, while CGS-CIMB reiterated its ‘add' call, with TP remaining at 82 sen. In a research note on Wednesday (Feb 9), RHB Research said it was positive on the disposal as it believed that the disposal was a value-unlocking move by YTLP to realise its mature investment. “The rationale of the disposal is to realise gains from a mature investment, which will provide financial flexibility for future investments. “While YTLP will likely record a one-off disposal gain of RM2.2 billion, we decrease our full financial year 2022-2024 forecast (FY22-24F) earnings by 1% to 8% on the absence of ElectraNet’s earnings,” it added. Meanwhile, Maybank IB said the proposed significantly-accretive disposal of ElectraNet brings to the fore the YTLP dichotomy — immensely valuable concessions (if crystallised) against depressed recent earnings. “We believe risk-reward has turned favourable, with earnings possibly recovering upon the eventual commissioning of Attarat Power Co,” it said. CGS-CIMB Research, in another note, said it was positive on the deal as the proposed disposal was a good opportunity for YTLP to realise gains from its mature investment, optimise its business portfolio, and venture into feasible new businesses that complement its existing assets. “We leave our forecasts unchanged, given that the proceeds could be subject to adjustments and pending more information disclosures. “As such, we reiterate our ‘add’ call, given the anticipated stronger FY22-24F earnings and decent dividend yields,” it said, adding that stronger-than-expected earnings from multi-utilities are key potential re-rating catalysts. At 10.41am, YTLP was higher by 6.5 sen to 66.5 sen, with 9.40 million shares transacted. Read also: YTL Power to dispose of entire stake in Australia’s ElectraNet for RM3 bil\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 8): Genting Malaysia Bhd's (GenM) operating unit Resorts World Genting (RWG) has announced that the casino and hotel group's Genting SkyWorlds Theme Park (pictured) in Malaysia has officially opened on Tuesday (Feb 8). “Genting SkyWorlds Theme Park is officially open!” RWG said in an update on Facebook. GenM was reported to have told attendees at the pre-opening preview of its long-awaited outdoor theme park, which had cost the group some US$800 million (around RM3.3 billion), that Genting SkyWorlds is scheduled to open to the public in February. In July 2019, GenM told Bursa Malaysia that it had resolved its dispute with 20th Century Fox Film Corp, Fox Entertainment Group LLC, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc and The Walt Disney Co over the development of its outdoor theme park. The settlement between the parties in 2019 grants GenM a licence to use certain intellectual properties belonging to Fox which include Ice Age, Night at the Museum and Planet of the Apes, among many others. The theme park, which was originally intended to be a 20th Century Fox World-branded park, was changed to Genting SkyWorlds after The Walt Disney Co acquired the Twenty-First Century Fox group of companies in 2018. Genting SkyWorlds Theme Park occupies 26 acres, boasting 26 rides and attractions, and will be able to accommodate 20,000 visitors at 50% capacity due to the pandemic-imposed standard operating procedures. Meanwhile, Maybank Investment Bank, RHB Research and Public Investment Bank have ‘buy’ or ‘outperform’ calls on GenM, with target prices of RM3.38, RM3.58 and RM3.25, respectively. The recommendations by the research houses were grounded on the opening of its long-anticipated Genting SkyWorlds Theme Park, which is a direct beneficiary of the tourism recovery theme. At noon break on Tuesday (Feb 8), GenM’s share price was eight sen higher or 2.89% to RM2.85 for a market capitalisation of RM16.92 billion based on 5.65 billion shares.\n",
