      "PHNOM PENH (Feb 24): Malaysia’s economic development and total foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2021 showed that the country is on good track to keep its projections to achieve its economic targets, Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ismail Sabri Yaakob said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on reports published by the Department of Statistics Malaysia and Bank Negara Malaysia, the country's economy grew 3.1% in 2021 against a contraction of 5.6% in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Even though Covid-19, as I mentioned earlier, has had a big impact on the economy, we can still expand.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, he said total FDI also increased to more than RM50 billion in 2021, compared with RM14.6 billion in 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This positive indicator gives the impression that the country is heading towards an economic recovery and [will] achieve the gross domestic product projection of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2022, in line with the projections made by the IMF (International Monetary Fund) and the World Bank,\" he said at the Keluarga Malaysia dinner in Cambodia on Wednesday (Feb 23).\n",
      "\n",
      "This is Ismail Sabri's first official visit to Cambodia since he was sworn in as the ninth prime minister on Aug 21 last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So, in terms of the economy, we aim to continue to grow and the government will continue to take various actions to ensure that our economy continues to grow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Among others, in an effort to revive the country's economy and help the people affected, the government has provided business financing assistance through the Semarak Niaga programme worth RM40 billion recently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This programme is specifically devised to help micro, small and medium enterprises in reviving their businesses.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ismail Sabri said the programme includes direct loans, financing guarantees and equity injections for the benefit of every group of entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides, under the Jamin Kerja campaign, the government is providing 600,000 job opportunities to reduce the unemployment rate and protect the well-being of the people who had lost their jobs due to the pandemic, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "All these initiatives are expected to have an impact by year end, the prime minister said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Halal industry potential in Cambodia\n",
      "\n",
      "For Malaysian businessmen in Cambodia, Ismail Sabri encouraged them to continue to seize the opportunities to trade with Cambodia and increase bilateral trade volumes.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I would like to encourage more Malaysian businessmen and investors to be more active here, especially in the halal industry. Malaysia should take the opportunity to expand the halal industry business in Cambodia,\" he said, adding that Cambodia is home to the Cham-Malay community of about 800,000 people.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is a potential and halal products are not only for Muslims, but also non-Muslims who also accept them as they are based on cleanliness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There are about 5,000 Malaysians residing in Cambodia, of whom about 2,000 are based in the capital Phnom Penh and have been involved in various businesses since 1994.\n",

      "Article's Text:\n",
      "All eyes are on Malaysia’s inflation data for January due on Thursday, given the rising prices that consumers have been faced with in recent months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) — which measures what people pay for goods and services — trended down slightly to 3.2% year on year in December from 3.3% y-o-y in November 2021. December was nonetheless the second consecutive month where inflation stayed above 3% on a yearly basis, spurred by higher food and non-alcoholic beverage prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Core inflation inched past 1% y-o-y for the first time since September 2020 to 1.1% in December 2021. On a full-year basis, inflation stood at 2.5%.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the local corporate front, there will be a slew of fourth-quarter corporate earnings announcements this week, with several big-cap names on the list. One is Axiata Group Bhd, which is expected to release its 4QFY2021 earnings on Tuesday, while its peer Maxis Bhd will be announcing its 4QFY2021 earnings on Thursday. Tenaga Nasional Bhd and Telekom Malaysia Bhd are expected to release their 4QFY2021 results on Friday.\n",
      "\n",
      "What could be of interest is Supermax Corp Bhd’s 2QFY2022 earnings announcement that is expected to take place on Tuesday. The rubber glove maker was in the news recently after the group and the Canadian government mutually terminated two existing contracts for the supply of nitrile gloves on account of allegations of forced labour issues and the expected timelines for the final audit results on its labour practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier, the Canadian government had put on hold the delivery of glove orders from Supermax on Nov 10, 2021, upon the announcement of a withhold release order issued to the glove maker by the US Customs and Border Protection on allegations of forced labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "CGS-CIMB Research said in a Jan 20 report that it viewed the news negatively as it estimated the orders from the Canadian government to make up about 9% of Supermax’s FY2021 revenue.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the courts, the hearing for Serba Dinamik Holdings Bhd and its four subsidiaries’ application for judicial management to enable the group to restructure its finances will take place on Feb 21. Serba — which, together with four executives, has been charged by the Securities Commission Malaysia with submitting false statements — said the move follows “a series of events” that have affected its cash flow due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has significantly slowed the timing of payments by its customers as well as the progress of the projects undertaken by the group.\n",

      "International Sdn Bhd’s US$1.18 billion civil suit against him, on Feb 22.\n",
      "\n",
      "Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor’s graft trial, related to a solar hybrid project in Sarawak, will continue on Wednesday. The trial will see the former first lady of Malaysia’s department head Datuk Seri Siti Azizah Sheikh Abod being cross-examined. The trial was postponed earlier due to Rosmah’s counsel’s close contact with a Covid-19 positive case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rosmah is accused of seeking RM187.5 million or a 15% cut of a RM1.25 billion project from former Jepak Holdings Sdn Bhd managing director Saidi Abang Samsudin in 2016 for helping to secure the project. She is also accused of accepting an additional RM6.5 million from Saidi — through her aide Datuk Rizal Mansor back then — as a reward for helping the company obtain the said project via direct negotiations with the Ministry of Education.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the international front, there will be the monetary policy decision by the Reserve Bank of New Zealand on Feb 23. Most economists forecast that the central bank will raise its official cash rate by 25 basis points to 1%.\n",

      "The preliminary February private sector manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) survey results will be released on Feb 21 for most advanced economies, while the PMI for the US will be released on Feb 22.\n",
      "\n",
      "“February’s PMI readings will be keenly watched. Specifically, consumer services’ performance will be observed after having been hard hit by the deterioration in Covid-19 conditions brought about by the spread of the more infectious variant. The trends with price pressures attributed to disruptions towards materials and staff will also be in focus, particularly given the focus on monetary policy tightening,” says IHS Markit in a report last Thursday.\n",

      "n\n",
      "Article's Text:\n",
      "For many people, the main landmark in Taman Connaught would be the Taman Connaught Night Market in Jalan Cerdas. At 2km long, it is one of the longest night markets in Malaysia.\n",
      "\n",
      "It operates every Wednesday, when the stretch of road it occupies is closed to cars. Prior to the pandemic, it had more than 700 stalls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Located next to the East-West Link Expressway, Jalan Cerdas has other visible landmarks such as ikon Connaught Shopping Mall, UCSI University, Wisma UCSI, CMC Centre as well as McDonald’s Taman Connaught Drive-Thru.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most prominent of these is UCSI University, which occupies 20 acres along Jalan Puncak Menara Gading. According to its website, the campus has seven buildings for academic and residential purposes. The university has plans to build a five-star hotel, 12 levels of parking and student accommodation, administrative offices, restaurants, a ballroom and a clubhouse. Meanwhile, Wisma UCSI — located next to ikon Connaught Shopping Mall in Jalan Cerdas — houses UCSI College.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are many businesses along Jalan Cerdas (Photo by Low Yen Yeing/The Edge)\n",
      "\n",
      "Jalan Cerdas intersects several streets, namely Jalan Cergas, Jalan Mahir, Jalan Cerdas 1, Jalan Cerdik, Jalan Arif 1, Jalan Pintas, Jalan Puncak Menara Gading and Jalan Puncak Gading. These streets lead to the residential area of Taman Connaught and other parts of Cheras.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jalan Cerdas, together with Jalan Cerdas 1, Jalan Cerdik, Jalan Puncak Menara Gading and Jalan Puncak Gading, are commercial streets with shop­offices. There are many businesses and services here, especially branches of banks such as CIMB Bank, Public Bank, HSBC Amanah, Standard Chartered Saadiq, Alliance Bank, RHB Bank, Hong Leong Bank, AmBank as well as Maybank.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are also plenty of eateries, beauty salons, clinics, dental clinics and convenience stores in this part of Taman Connaught.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the Covid-19 pandemic broke out and the subsequent Movement Control Orders, these commercial roads — especially Jalan Cerdas with its highway frontage — were busy. That translated into traffic congestion and a shortage of parking lots during the day. Many motorists resorted to parking their cars in the residential areas nearby to run their errands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metro Homes Realty Bhd executive director See Kok Loong notes that this commercial area has one of the best locations in Cheras, as it faces the expressway.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Jalan Cerdas has maximum exposure and most corporations prefer this location; that’s why there are many major banks here. Jalan Cerdas 1 is an older development that usually houses transition shops. The Jalan Menara Gading 1 area, meanwhile, is a newer area and closer to UCSI University and UCSI College; therefore it attracts more lifestyle shops like cafés,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In 2020, there was a transaction of a 3.5-storey shopoffice (land size: 1,540 sq ft; built-up: 4,800 sq ft) in Jalan Cerdas at RM2.78 million. Also, three retail lots, sized from 1,300 to 2,800 sq ft, on the ground floor of ikon Connaught were sold at RM1,200 to RM1,800 psf.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the other streets, See notes that Jalan Menara Gading 1 has also registered several transactions. In 2019, a 3-storey shopoffice on the street (land size: 1,765 sq ft; built-up: 5,500 sq ft) was transacted at RM2.78 million. In 2018, there were five transactions, including a corner unit (land area: 3,500 sq ft; built-up: 9,200 sq ft) that was sold at RM5.1 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The future [of this area] is great with its visibility, alongside [the presence of] UCSI University and UCSI College. Also, the night market is a landmark. The popularity of the shops is not affected even with the high-tension cable running in front of them and there were hardly any empty shops there prior to the pandemic,” See concludes.\n",

      "n\n",
      "Article's Text:\n",
      "APPLICATIONS will be open on Tuesday (Feb 15) for local employers to recruit foreign workers in the permitted sectors, including manufacturing, construction, agriculture, services, mining and quarrying and domestic helpers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is welcome news for industries that have been hard pressed for foreign workers over the two years of the Covid-19 pandemic, due to the earlier hiring freeze by the government. Employers have also blamed the labour shortage for their losses. Hence, by allowing the hiring of foreign workers, employers say it would help to quicken the rate of recovery for businesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee Heng Guie, executive director of the Associated Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Malaysia’s Socio-Economic Research Centre (SERC), says while businesses have always supported the government’s call to reduce the over-dependence on foreign workers, the acute shortage of workers requires a quick resolution and pragmatic prioritisation to support the local economy towards recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Business recovery efforts will be severely hampered if employers are not provided with the necessary workers, especially in sectors that are still dependent on foreign workers. Employers are very frustrated at not being able to engage the necessary workers as locals still shun the work performed by foreign workers,” he tells The Edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proponents of foreign labour argue that it makes sense to address the immediate issue at hand, given the risks of labour shortages hampering business growth and economic recovery. However, one has to ask if the country’s aspirations to move up the value chain and reduce the reliance on low-skilled foreign labour will be realised should hiring resume to what it was before.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The two-year pandemic would be a ‘wasted opportunity’ if industries were to revert to the use of foreign workers without considering plans to upgrade, adopt new technology and automate those processes that are performed by low-skilled foreign workers. Such industries should be encouraged to relocate to low labour cost countries in the region,” opines Sunway University economics professor Yeah Kim Leng, calling the over-dependence on foreign labour a long-standing structural problem that the country has been grappling with.\n",
      "\n",
      "He says more critical now is whether the country is using opportunities such as the large budget announced for the rebuilding of the economy to increase the rate and volume of quality investments, skilled job creation and production of high-value goods and services.\n",
      "\n",
      "“To the extent that the relaxation of the foreign worker intake does not jeopardise the industrial upgrading of the firms and industries in the long term, but contributes to raising the country’s income in the short term, then the ‘wasted opportunity’ would be a moot point,” he adds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The opportunity for change to take place is still there. People in the automation industry share anecdotal evidence of the changes that have been taking place among manufacturers as a result of the pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We have seen instances of manufacturers who have relied on 100% manual labour on their production lines prior to the pandemic now deciding to be fully automated. They are starting to see that machines are more consistent and result in fewer errors in the production process,” says an engineer in the automation field who asked not to be named.\n",
      "\n",
      "Policy-wise, there have been many proposals aimed at reducing the dependency on foreign labour. One such proposal is a multi-tier, market-based system for the hiring of foreign workers, which aims to allow the forces of demand and supply to determine the number of labourers needed. However, how successful this is in fulfilling its objective will depend on the implementation process.\n",
      "\n",
      "SERC’s Lee believes that the multi-tier levy, market-based system would help to reduce dependency on foreign labour but the plan, which was supposed to start on Jan 1, has been deferred to July 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since the Eighth Malaysia Plan (2001-2005), the country has been talking about reducing its dependence on foreign labour. In the most recent two Malaysia plans — the 11th and the 12th — the government has placed a threshold to lower the number of foreign workers to not more than 15% of the workforce.\n",
      "\n",
      "Official statistics show that the authorities have managed to keep the number of foreign workers under the 15% threshold. In 2021, the official number of foreign workers stood at 1.1 million, making up about 7% of the total work force.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, labour activists say many foreign workers have fallen out of the official numbers because they do not have proper papers during the pandemic for a variety of reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "The population of undocumented foreign workers in the country is believed to be large, with some saying that the number is equal to that of legal foreign workers, if not more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Notably, the number of foreign workers recruited in Malaysia is currently based on a set of conditions and on a ratio of local workers to foreign labour varied by sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, in the manufacturing sector, the ratio of locals to foreign workers is between 1:3, 1:1 and 2:1, depending on whether it is an export-oriented industry, non-export-oriented industry or the electronics and electrical products industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sectors like plantation have a quota based on hectares while the services industry’s quota is based on the number of seats in the case of an eatery.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, one thing has been changed in the hiring process of foreign labour: Two weeks ago, Home Minister Datuk Seri Hamzah Zainudin announced that the government will abolish the “special quota” for the recruitment of foreign workers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, all applications from employers will go through the ministry’s evaluation committee to determine the number of foreign workers eligible to be employed in accordance with the set terms and conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was obviously met with mixed reactions, with some calling it a positive move while others feel that it could potentially derail the economic recovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Malaysian Employers Federation is one party that had expressed its concern about this abolishment, saying that the special quota system should continue as it provides businesses with a ready supply of labour to meet urgent needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "In contrast, the Federation of Manufacturers Malaysia (FMM) supports the move as it removes possible misuse and abuse of the system that results in excessive entries and the possibility of human trafficking issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee also opines that moving away from special quotas on recruitment will help to ensure a consistent and transparent process for all sectors, without any special treatment, and weed out unproductive rent-seeking.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Doing away with the middle men in the recruitment of foreign workers, replacing them with a direct recruitment end-to-end system, will expedite the recruitment process while helping to lower the cost of hiring. There is a need for developing a ‘simple evaluate-process-submit’ online recruitment system, backed by a centralised database for direct recruitment of workers,” says Lee.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth noting that the Public Accounts Committee had in November 2020 issued findings on the control of foreign workers that highlighted many issues with the process, one of which was that the number of approvals for special applications was higher than that of regular applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bipartisan oversight committee deems the practice unhealthy, adding that “such practice does not meet the original purpose of the foreign worker quota application process”, which is to impose strict qualification screening.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is well known that the foreign worker recruitment process in Malaysia is complex. Employers frequently use private employment agencies to recruit foreign workers and many have called out the practices of such agencies as lacking in transparency.\n",
      "\n",
      "“About 95% of Vietnamese low-skilled workers in the manufacturing sector were recruited by private employment agencies and only 2% of experienced [foreign workers] were directly hired by employers.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Opaque private recruitment practices, sometimes coupled with complex worker deployment procedures set out by governments in labour-sending countries, often involve burdensome recruitment fees, causing or increasing the indebtedness of foreign workers. The transaction costs can be as high as US$2,700 (RM11,000) — equivalent to 10 months’ earnings in Malaysia — but can vary, depending on the origin of the workers,” says World Bank Group in a report titled “Who is Keeping Score?” that was released in April 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Malaysia also has bilateral government-to-government agreements with countries like Bangladesh in a bid to help reduce costs and improve transparency in foreign worker recruitment practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the practices themselves continue to be shrouded in controversy. In 2018, recruitment from Bangladesh was frozen due to allegations of corruption and the involvement of a syndicate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Costs were not reduced nor was recruitment more transparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "In December last year, the two countries signed a new memorandum of understanding on the recruitment of workers from Bangladesh for employment in Malaysia. The contents of the agreement have not been disclosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is clear is that the foreign labour issue is a multidimensional one. With Malaysian employers needing for foreign labour to do jobs that locals won’t, even though many employers say that foreign labour is no longer “cheap” to hire, it feeds into a system of greed and exploitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Raising the minimum wage\n",
      "\n",
      "Not too long after the announcement of the abolishment of special quotas, the Ministry of Human Resources also said that it is looking into raising the minimum wage this year — it could potentially be increased to no more than RM1,500 per month. Currently, the minimum wage stands at RM1,200.\n",
      "\n",
      "Businesses say that a RM300 rise is too steep given that they have just emerged from the pandemic, adding that such a rise could derail the economic recovery as businesses struggle to cope with additional costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah agrees that the notion that many small and medium enterprises would not be in a position to bear the RM300 rise in the minimum wage should be studied objectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While evidence in other countries shows that raising the minimum wage does not result in an increase in unemployment, its negative impact on Malaysia’s economic recovery cannot be ruled out, given the likely fragile financial condition of many firms due to the prolonged pandemic.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If the wage increase is too sharp, there could be business closures and few start-ups, and that may dampen the recovery momentum, hence the proposal by businesses for a staggered increase to provide some lead time for business planning to cope with the proposed minimum wage increase,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Lee notes that the higher minimum wage would benefit 2.25 million workers in the country who are currently earning minimum wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "CGS-CIMB Research head of economics Ahmad Nazmi Idrus says the rise will benefit all workers to some degree, but cautions that a hike in wages without an increase in productivity is merely “inflationary”.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I think the idea is that a higher minimum wage provides the correct price signal for businesses to adopt better technologies. In a way, this will reduce foreign labour.\n",
      "\n",
      "“But the ultimate goal, in my opinion, is to raise the workers’ share of economic wealth. Take the gross domestic product by income released by the Department of Statistics Malaysia, for example. Sixty per cent of the wealth is held by the capital owners, while 37% is held by workers. This is low compared with other upper-middle income economies such as South Korea, at 54%,” he says.\n",

      "Target price: RM7.75 BUY\n",
      "\n",
      "MAYBANK INVESTMENT BANK RESEARCH (FEB 8): The long-expected winter season pickup in the dirty tanker market failed to materialise towards end-4Q21 as global Omicron-induced lockdown fears and softer Chinese imports limited tonnage demand. FY21 average spot freight rates for Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) and Suezmax (vessel class of 160,000 deadweight tonnage [DWT] capacity) saw their worst performance in a decade, while Aframax (vessel class of 80,000 to 120,000 DWT capacity) rates also hit an eight-year low during the period.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite an encouraging current order book-to-fleet ratio of a manageable 8% to 14% for FY22-24, about a third of FY22 scheduled tanker deliveries are in the more than 60,000 DWT range and, thus, likely to offset any significant near-term rate increases as the market recovers from multi-year lows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Positively for MISC, its petroleum fleet has a favourable term-to-spot ratio that could provide some support for its 4Q21 performance. MISC’s spot charter exposure between its VLCC, Suezmax and Aframax vessels at end-3Q21 stood at 13%, 27% and 46% respectively. Thus, notwithstanding a 32.6% m-o-m decrease in December spot rates for VLCCs (MISC’s spot exposure is low), marginal m-o-m increases in Suezmax (+9.7%) and Aframax (+4.9%) rates could provide the necessary support as MISC’s spot exposure in these segments are more substantial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Noting that MISC performed admirably in 3Q21 despite tepid spot rates in both the LNG and petroleum segments, we expect the company to pull through an equally difficult 4Q21. With the Mero 3 floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) continuing to accrete positively to MISC’s bottom line, coupled with the recent decision by Opec+ to stick to its planned output bumps in the light of soaring global oil prices and record-low global crude inventories, we make no changes to our forecasts, pending better visibility post-4Q21 results.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our earnings forecasts and SOP-based target price of RM7.75 are maintained at this juncture. MISC currently trades at an attractive one-year forward PER of 13 times, has a robust balance sheet and offers a solid dividend yield of 5%.\n",

We deem the earnings as below expectation due to a faster-than-expected decline in average selling price (ASP) and lower-than-expected utilisation rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s 3QFY22 earnings fell 72% q-o-q to RM259 million as ASP declined 40% q-o-q while sales volume slipped 17% q-o-q. The ASP decline is in line with the market price for gloves, which has passed its peak. As for sales volume, we gather that customers remain cautious in their purchase pattern due to declining ASP, coupled with logistic challenges caused by a global shipping container shortage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hartalega announced a 14.8 sen dividend. The ex-date will be on Feb 23 with the payment date on March 9. Operationally, the company’s near-term focus is on improving its efficiency. For 4QFY22, we expect the utilisation rate to improve to 60%-65% from 3QFY22’s 52%.\n",

Although the market share of its flagship brand Dunhill in the premium segment increased 1.9ppt in FY21, BAT’s FY21 gross margin crept down to 25.6% from 25.8% in FY20.

It is telling that there was down-trading already in 4Q21, as reflected in BAT’s gross margin declining 80bps q-o-q to 25.6%. With the disruption in the global supply chain pushing up prices of daily necessities, we are concerned that the q-o-q margin squeeze in 4Q21 presages more down-trading in 2022F. We cut FY22-23F EPS by 4%-10% to reflect lower sales volume, more purchases of VFM cigarettes and higher marketing expenses for BAT’s vapes.\n",

      "Farm Fresh's RM2 bil IPO valuation appears justified, say analysts\n",
      "n\n",
      "Article's Text:\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 18): Analysts say the RM2 billion valuation that Main Market-bound Farm Fresh Bhd is said to be looking at from its initial public offering (IPO) appears justified.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Khazanah Nasional Bhd-backed dairy producer, which is expected to be listed within the first quarter of the year, has yet to announce its IPO pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When contacted, Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong said a back-of-the-envelope calculation showed that Farm Fresh should be valued at about 60 times price-earnings (P/E) multiples based on the company’s profit after tax (PAT) of RM32.83 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 (FY21).\n",
      "\n",
      "Stripped off its one-off tax liability and penalty of RM25.71 million, Leong said Farm Fresh’s normalised PAT of RM58.54 million should value the company close to 30 times P/E multiple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to its peers, Farm Fresh’s valuation is sitting somewhere between Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd and Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N), he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trailing 12-month price-earnings (TTM P/E) ratio was 53.6 times for Nestle, 25.1 times for F&N and 24.4 times for Dutch Lady, according to Bloomberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another analyst, who requested anonymity, expects Farm Fresh to be valued at mid-20 times P/E, on par with F&N and Dutch Lady’s valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both analysts believe that Farm Fresh’s P/E valuation is justified, taking into account the company’s growth prospect and its leading market share in the ready-to-drink milk category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leong said the company can ride on the population growth and enjoy the benefits of economic reopening, which is a catalyst to spur demand for its products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, another analyst believes Farm Fresh can continue to chart strong earnings growth going forward, which will be driven by its increasing herd size for dairy cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the key drivers, which is their dairy cattle, has been increasing. As long as the company continues to allocate capex for farming, it should be able to continue to grow,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also observed that Farm Fresh’s products have gained popularity, given its shelf place in the retail stores has been expanding over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another [comparative] advantage for Farm Fresh is being an integrated dairy farming player, covering from (upstream) farming activity until (downstream) manufacturing, whereas its peer does not have in-house dairy farming and buying from others,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farm Fresh is Malaysia's second-largest player in the ready-to-drink milk category with a market share of 18%, and the third-largest in the yoghurt category with a market share of 11% for the first half of 2021, according to the company’s IPO draft prospectus posted on Securities Commission Malaysia website.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company operates five dairy farms in Malaysia and one in Australia, with a total herd size of 9,000 dairy cows and bulls. It also owns and operates two processing facilities in Malaysia, with the capacity to produce around 137 litres of finished goods annually and one processing facility in Australia, with the capacity to produce 84 million litres of processed milk annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "From FY19 to FY21, the company's PAT attributable to owners grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9% from RM27.4 million to RM36.2 million, while its revenue increased by a CAGR of 65.9% from RM178.2 million to RM490.5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing down additional costs to end-users\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst the industry-wide practice of increasing commodity prices, analysts expect Farm Fresh to be able to pass down the additional costs to end-users and protect its margin, given customers’ \"stickiness\" towards its products.\n",
      "\n",
      "MIDF Research, in an emailed response, said as with any other consumer staple companies, inflation is an issue at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There could be potential headwinds for the sector as whole, with the rise in raw material prices due to inflation. In order to maintain margins moving forward, companies in the sector might have to resort to passing on the higher raw material prices to consumers and hike prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, with its innovative distribution business model such as the home dealers system, we opine that there is a possibility that the company will be adaptable to navigate future business challenges,” said the research firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While fresh milk is a staple in Malaysian households, an increase in the price of milk could result in the price-sensitive consumers resorting to more affordable brands, considering the concurrent increase in the price of other household items. However, we note that the wide-range of milk options that the company offers, which includes plant-based milk, will remain a strong factor to maintain customer stickiness, despite potential price hikes,” it added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, another analyst said Farm Fresh is also able to pass down the additional cost via innovation by adjusting the products pricing in the form of providing value added features to convince the customers to buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloomberg, citing sources, reported last week that Farm Fresh had attracted almost 30 cornerstone investors, including Aberdeen Standard Investments and AIA Group Ltd, in a planned IPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Eastern Life Assurance, Franklin Templeton Investment and some Malaysian state funds had also signed on, and the first-time share sale is expected to raise about RM1 billion, the report said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farm Fresh’s IPO is set to be the country’s biggest since last June, when CTOS Digital Bhd, which runs a credit reporting agency, and its shareholders raised RM1.21 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday (Feb 15), Farm Fresh signed an underwriting agreement with CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB IB), Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd, AmInvestment Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd for its IPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPO — of up to 743.2 million shares in Farm Fresh — comprises an offer for sale of up to 520.2 million existing shares and a public issue of 223 million new shares. The 743.2 million IPO shares comprise an institutional offering of up to 687.4 million IPO shares and a retail offering of 55.7 million issue shares.\n",

      "Jalan Cerdas, together with Jalan Cerdas 1, Jalan Cerdik, Jalan Puncak Menara Gading and Jalan Puncak Gading, are commercial streets with shop­offices.

      "RHB Research analyst Lee Meng Horng said in a note that he expects a better performance for Guan Chong into the financial year ending Dec 31, 2022 (FY22) on pent-up global demand, growing contributions from overseas operations, and expansion drives.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The current below-peer valuation provides a buying opportunity to a valued and stable consumer name like Guan Chong with an increasing global footprint,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He kept his target price (TP) for Guan Chong at RM4, which indicated a potential upside of 31% based on its closing price of RM3.05 on Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "“At an attractive 13 times of FY22 price-earnings ratio (PER), we believe investors should position into a stable consumer product name like Guan Chong, given its unique global presence and growth angle from international expansions, building on its current earnings base secured by its forward selling mechanism,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also noted that Guan Chong’s fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 (4QFY21) concluded on a high with FY21 earnings of RM156 million coming within his expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The strong quarter-on-quarter (+48.7%) and year-on-year (+9.5%) quarterly earnings were aided by both topline and margin improvements,” he said while maintaining its earnings forecast.\n",

      "\n",
      "He remained optimistic on Guan Chong’s medium-to-longer term outlook with its future growth underpinned by: i) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) yield improvement as impact of living income differential (LID) subsides; ii) recovery of cocoa butter’s average selling price (ASP) to be bolstered by demand revival for upmarket chocolates; and iii) its overseas expansion plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also said Guan Chong’s 4QFY21 core net profit of RM51.2 million is above his expectation, and the outperformance is mainly attributed to stronger sales volume during the quarter. He made no changes in its earnings post-results.\n",
      "\n",

      "n\n",
      "Article's Text:\n",
      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 18): Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd's earnings projections have been lowered on lower sales and average selling price (ASP) outlook, despite its net profit for the fourth quarter ended Dec 31, 2021 (4QFY21) coming within expectations, said analysts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earnings downgrade came after the company reported a 60% plunge in its 4QFY21 net profit on lower sales and normalisation of ASP across its glove products.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the financial year ended Dec 31, 2021 (FY21), Kossan’s net profit jumped 162.6% to RM2.85 billion, from RM1.09 billion in the previous year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hong Leong Investment Bank analyst Sophie Chua Siu Li in a note Friday said that despite Kossan results coming in line, she lowered her forecasts for FY22 to FY23 by 43% to 67%, to account for the lower ASP as well higher operating costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Going forward, we expect industry-wide headwinds to continue to linger, with ASPs and margins remaining under pressure,” she said while maintaining a \"hold\" call on the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consequently, her target price (TP) for Kossan was lowered to RM1.53 (from RM2.65), implying a valuation of 12 times the price-earnings ratio (PER) on its FY22 earnings per share (EPS) of 12.7 sen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Affin Hwang Investment Bank analyst Ng Chi Hoong said 2022 would be a challenging year for Kossan, as he is expecting ASPs to continue to decline before the company is able to deliver more products to its client.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Due to the shipping constraints and declining ASPs, we cut our EPS forecasts for FY22 to FY23 by 28% to 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As a result, we also lower our TP to RM1.20 from RM2.40 (based on an unchanged nine times of 2022 estimated price-earnings ratio [PER]), and downgrade our call to 'sell' from 'hold', as investor sentiment on the sector is likely to remain weak due to uncertainty on ASPs,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, BIMB Securities analyst Saffa Amanina said she revised down Kossan's FY22 and FY23 earnings by 45% and 23% respectively, to factor in lower FY22 and FY23 blended ASP assumptions to US$25 (RM104.62) and US$24 (from US$29 and US$26) per 1,000 pieces, lower sales volume, lower margin and one-off prosperity tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "In tandem with earnings revision, she derived a lower TP of RM1.80 (from RM2.40) for Kossan based on unchanged PER of 15 times pegged on 2023 EPS of 12 sen. She also maintained a \"hold\" call on the stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Kossan's latest profit was deemed in line with her expectation, she concurred with other analysts that tough operating conditions are likely to persist in 2022.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We expect Kossan’s 1HFY22 earnings to be impacted by lower ASP as well as volume due to supply chain disruptions caused by shipment issues and labour shortage.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Profit margin could further erode due to overall higher operating cost as well as one-off prosperity tax,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a separate note, Kenanga Research analyst Raymond Choo Ping Khoon said he downgraded his FY22 net profit forecast for Kossan by 10% as he changed his ASP assumption from US$27 to US$25 per 1,000 pieces and nudged down earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) margin from 20% to 19%.\n",
      "\n",
      "While reiterating \"market perform\" on the stock, he lowered its TP from RM1.80 to RM1.65 based on 13 times of FY22 EPS of 12.5 sen.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The group highlighted that the performance in the quarter was also affected by logistic challenges caused by the global shipping container shortage which we understand are unlikely to abate over the next two quarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In the meantime, margins in subsequent quarters could be impacted as raw material cost is not adjusting as fast as falling ASP and hence earnings are expected to be lower sequentially in 1QFY22,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "TA Securities analyst Tan Kong Jin said he reduced Kossan FY22 and FY23 earnings projections by 27% and 21.8% after reducing its sales volumes by 8.7% and net margin by 2.5 percentage points.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Looking forward, we expect 1QFY22 ASP to decline by circa-33% quarter-on-quarter but volumes to improve due restocking and inventory adjustments by customers,\n",
      "\n",
      "“The group’s current capacity stood at 33.5 billion gloves per annum. We believe the group will slow down its expansion plans whereby we expect Phase 1 of P21 (two billion gloves) to start production in 2HFY22 (previously 1HFY22),” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "While reiterating a \"buy\" call on Kossan, he lowered its TP to RM1.96 from RM2.50 following the earnings revision. The TP was based on an unchanged PE of 17 times of its 2023 EPS.\n",
      "\n",
      "RHB Investment Bank analyst Sean Chew also cut Kossan earnings forecast by 5% for FY23, after revising its sales volume assumption on latest changes in its expansion plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Looking into the quarters ahead, we believe earnings will continue to normalise as ASP finds an equilibrium,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, after the recent share price retracement, he sees value emerging for Kossan given its inexpensive valuations at 13 times of FY23 PE (below its 10-year average of 16 times).\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, he maintained a \"buy\" call on Kossan, with an unchanged TP of RM2.05.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for MIDF Research, Kossan FY21 results were below its expectations, and the negative variation was attributable to declining ASPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The group expects the supply and demand imbalance to persist in the near term and the continued tapering of glove demand and ASP.\n",
      "\n",
      "“In spite of the 4QFY21 underperformance, we maintain our forward earnings estimates as we believe we have already imputed sufficiently low ASP and demand assumptions in our forecast for FY22 onwards,” it said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It maintained a \"neutral\" call on Kossan and revised down its TP to RM1.78 from RM2.17. The TP is derived from a revised valuation of 10.25 times PER pegged to FY22 EPS of 17.3 sen.\n",
      "\n",
      "At 10.35am Friday, Kossan rose five sen or 2.96% to RM1.74, valuing the group at RM4.37 billion.\n",

      "KUALA LUMPUR (Feb 18): Analysts say the RM2 billion valuation that Main Market-bound Farm Fresh Bhd is said to be looking at from its initial public offering (IPO) appears justified.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Khazanah Nasional Bhd-backed dairy producer, which is expected to be listed within the first quarter of the year, has yet to announce its IPO pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "When contacted, Malacca Securities Sdn Bhd senior analyst Kenneth Leong said a back-of-the-envelope calculation showed that Farm Fresh should be valued at about 60 times price-earnings (P/E) multiples based on the company’s profit after tax (PAT) of RM32.83 million for the financial year ended March 31, 2021 (FY21).\n",
      "\n",
      "Stripped off its one-off tax liability and penalty of RM25.71 million, Leong said Farm Fresh’s normalised PAT of RM58.54 million should value the company close to 30 times P/E multiple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to its peers, Farm Fresh’s valuation is sitting somewhere between Nestle (Malaysia) Bhd, Dutch Lady Milk Industries Bhd and Fraser & Neave Holdings Bhd (F&N), he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trailing 12-month price-earnings (TTM P/E) ratio was 53.6 times for Nestle, 25.1 times for F&N and 24.4 times for Dutch Lady, according to Bloomberg.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another analyst, who requested anonymity, expects Farm Fresh to be valued at mid-20 times P/E, on par with F&N and Dutch Lady’s valuation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both analysts believe that Farm Fresh’s P/E valuation is justified, taking into account the company’s growth prospect and its leading market share in the ready-to-drink milk category.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leong said the company can ride on the population growth and enjoy the benefits of economic reopening, which is a catalyst to spur demand for its products.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, another analyst believes Farm Fresh can continue to chart strong earnings growth going forward, which will be driven by its increasing herd size for dairy cattle.\n",
      "\n",
      "“One of the key drivers, which is their dairy cattle, has been increasing. As long as the company continues to allocate capex for farming, it should be able to continue to grow,” he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "He also observed that Farm Fresh’s products have gained popularity, given its shelf place in the retail stores has been expanding over the years.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Another [comparative] advantage for Farm Fresh is being an integrated dairy farming player, covering from (upstream) farming activity until (downstream) manufacturing, whereas its peer does not have in-house dairy farming and buying from others,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farm Fresh is Malaysia's second-largest player in the ready-to-drink milk category with a market share of 18%, and the third-largest in the yoghurt category with a market share of 11% for the first half of 2021, according to the company’s IPO draft prospectus posted on Securities Commission Malaysia website.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company operates five dairy farms in Malaysia and one in Australia, with a total herd size of 9,000 dairy cows and bulls. It also owns and operates two processing facilities in Malaysia, with the capacity to produce around 137 litres of finished goods annually and one processing facility in Australia, with the capacity to produce 84 million litres of processed milk annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "From FY19 to FY21, the company's PAT attributable to owners grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.9% from RM27.4 million to RM36.2 million, while its revenue increased by a CAGR of 65.9% from RM178.2 million to RM490.5 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Passing down additional costs to end-users\n",
      "\n",
      "Amidst the industry-wide practice of increasing commodity prices, analysts expect Farm Fresh to be able to pass down the additional costs to end-users and protect its margin, given customers’ \"stickiness\" towards its products.\n",
      "\n",
      "MIDF Research, in an emailed response, said as with any other consumer staple companies, inflation is an issue at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There could be potential headwinds for the sector as whole, with the rise in raw material prices due to inflation. In order to maintain margins moving forward, companies in the sector might have to resort to passing on the higher raw material prices to consumers and hike prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"However, with its innovative distribution business model such as the home dealers system, we opine that there is a possibility that the company will be adaptable to navigate future business challenges,” said the research firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "“While fresh milk is a staple in Malaysian households, an increase in the price of milk could result in the price-sensitive consumers resorting to more affordable brands, considering the concurrent increase in the price of other household items. However, we note that the wide-range of milk options that the company offers, which includes plant-based milk, will remain a strong factor to maintain customer stickiness, despite potential price hikes,” it added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, another analyst said Farm Fresh is also able to pass down the additional cost via innovation by adjusting the products pricing in the form of providing value added features to convince the customers to buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bloomberg, citing sources, reported last week that Farm Fresh had attracted almost 30 cornerstone investors, including Aberdeen Standard Investments and AIA Group Ltd, in a planned IPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "Great Eastern Life Assurance, Franklin Templeton Investment and some Malaysian state funds had also signed on, and the first-time share sale is expected to raise about RM1 billion, the report said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farm Fresh’s IPO is set to be the country’s biggest since last June, when CTOS Digital Bhd, which runs a credit reporting agency, and its shareholders raised RM1.21 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Tuesday (Feb 15), Farm Fresh signed an underwriting agreement with CIMB Investment Bank Bhd (CIMB IB), Maybank Investment Bank Bhd, Affin Hwang Investment Bank Bhd, AmInvestment Bank Bhd, Hong Leong Investment Bank Bhd and RHB Investment Bank Bhd for its IPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "The IPO — of up to 743.2 million shares in Farm Fresh — comprises an offer for sale of up to 520.2 million existing shares and a public issue of 223 million new shares. The 743.2 million IPO shares comprise an institutional offering of up to 687.4 million IPO shares and a retail offering of 55.7 million issue shares.\n",
